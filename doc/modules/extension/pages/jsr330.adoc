= JSR-330: Using reflexivity to auto-inject
:version: 7.1.0
:branch: 7.1


== Introduction

Kodein-DI offers a module that implements reflexivity injection based on the JSR-330 `javax.inject.*` annotations.
There are two reasons to use this module:

- You are moving a code base from a Java injection library (such as Guice or Dagger) and want the Java code to work the same while there still is injected java code.
- You want to easilly use Kodein-DI in a Java code.
- That's it!

Using this module with Kotlin code means adding a lot of reflexivity at run-time that can easily be avoided in Kotlin (but not in Java).

CAUTION: Every-thing that is described here is *a lot less performant* than using classic DI injection methods.
         PLEASE DO NOT USE ON KOTLIN CLASSES.
         Kittens *will* die painfully if you do!


[[install]]
== Install

=== With Maven

[source,xml,subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.kodein.di&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;kodein-di-jxinject-jvm&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
----

IMPORTANT: Do not remove the "kodein-generic-jvm" (or "kodein-erased-jvm") dependency.
           Both dependencies must be declared.


=== With Gradle

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
compile 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-jxinject-jvm:{version}'
----

IMPORTANT: Do not remove the "kodein-generic-jvm" (or "kodein-erased-jvm") dependency.
           Both dependencies must be declared.


[[import-module]]
=== Import the module.

In your di binding configuration add the `jxInjectorModule`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: importing the JxInjector module
----
val di = DI {
    import(jxInjectorModule)
    /* Other bindings */
}
----


== JavaX injections

=== Constructor injection

You can create a new instance of a given class, provided that:

- The class has only one constructor
- Or the class have one of its constructors annotated with `@Inject`.

It is a good practice, however, to always have an `@Inject` constructor, even if it is the only constructor.

.Example: Java class that can be automatically created with injections
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject
    public MyJavaController(Connection connection, FileSystem fs) {
        /* ... */
    }
    /* ... */
}
----

You can then create instances of such classes by using `di.jx` in Kotlin, or `Jx.of(di)` in Java.

.Example: Creating a new instance in Kotlin
[source, kotlin]
----
val controller = di.jx.newInstance<MyJavaController>()
----

.Example: Creating a new instance in Java
[source, java]
----
MyJavaController controller = Jx.of(di).newInstance(MyJavaController.class);
----

=== Field injection

You can inject fields of a class by annotating them with `@Inject`.

.Example: Java class whose fields can be automatically injected.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject
    Connection connection;

    @Inject
    FileSystem fs;

    /* ... */
}
----

You can then inject existing instances of such classes by using `di.jx` in Kotlin, or `Jx.of(di)` in Java.

.Example: Injecting an existing instance in Kotlin
[source, kotlin]
----
val controller = MyJavaController()
di.jx.inject(controller)
----

.Example: Injecting an existing instance in Java
[source, java]
----
MyJavaController controller = new MyJavaController();
Jx.of(di).inject(controller);
----

=== Method injection

WARNING: Method injection is supported to be compatible with Java injection libraries.
         It is, however, widely considered as the less semantic injection method.

You can have `@Inject` annotated method be called at injection.

.Example: Java class whose method will be automatically called on injection.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject
    public setIO(Connection connection, FileSystem fs) {
        /* ... */
    }
    /* ... */
}
----

You know the drill, use `di.jx` in Kotlin or `Jx.of(di)` in Java the exact same way as for field injection.


== Being specific

=== Qualifiers annotations

`javax.inject` libraries use the concept of "qualifier annotations", which serves the same purpose as DI's tag system.

The `@Named` annotation is a qualifier provided by default, and is supported by default in Kodein-DI-JxInject.
In Java, any field or method / constructor parameter annotated with `@Named("whatever")` will use the `String` value as tag.

.Example: Java class which uses named injection.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject @Named("SQL")
    Connection connection; <1>

    @Inject setConnection(@Named("SQL") Connection connection) { /*...*/ } <2>
}
----
<1>: Field injection.
<2>: Method injection.

To inject the `connection` field, DI will essentially retrieve as `di.instance<Connection>(tag = "SQL")`.

For any other qualifier annotation, you need to provide a function that will transform a qualifier annotation to a tag.

.Example: Registering a qualifier annotation
[source, kotlin]
----
val di = DI {
    import(jxInjectorModule)

    /* Other bindings */

    jxQualifier<MyQualifier> { MyTag(it.value) } <1>
}
----
<1>: Transforms a `MyQualifier` qualifier annotation into a `MyTag` DI tag.

=== Using erased bindings

If you need to inject erased binding, you can annotate the field or method / constructor parameter with the `@ErasedBinding` annotation.

.Example: Java class which uses erased binding injection.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject @ErasedBinding List<Connection> connections;
}
----

=== Optionnal injection

If you need to inject something only if it was bound (and set it to null otherwise), you can use the `@OrNull` annotation.

.Example: Java class which uses nullable injection.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject @OrNull Connection connectionOrNull;
}
----

=== Provider & Factory injection

You can inject a provider, either by using `javax.inject.Provider` or `kotlin.jvm.functions.Function0`.
Note that if you are using the latter, you need to use the `@ProviderFun` annotation.

.Example: Java class which uses provider injection.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject Provider<Connection> connectionJXProvider;
    @Inject @ProviderFun Function0<Connection> connectionKotlinProvider;
}
----

To inject a factory, you need to use `kotlin.jvm.functions.Function1` annotated with `@FactoryFun`.

.Example: Java class which uses factory injection.
[source, java]
----
public class MyJavaController {
    @Inject @ProviderFun Function0<String, Connection> connectionFactory;
}
----
