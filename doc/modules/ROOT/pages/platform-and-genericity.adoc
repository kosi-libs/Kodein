= Platform compatibility & Genericity

IMPORTANT: From `6.3.0` On the JVM, you must be targeting `JDK 1.8` minimum!

_Kodein-DI_ is compatible with all platforms that the Kotlin language compiles to: JVM & compatible (Android), Javascript and all the Kotlin/Native targets.

Since `7.0.0`, a new https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-Type[type system] has been designed and included to _Kodein-DI_.
Thus, it appears to the developer that there is no more _obvious_ differences between platforms, you no longer have to choose between `erased` or `generic` dependencies.
Starting from `7.0.0`, _Kodein-DI_ is using the `generic` version of the type system, meaning you should be able to bind generics easily for _Kotlin/Multiplatform_ projects.
So, whatever platform you are targeting, `bind<List<String>>()` and `bind<List<Int>>()` will represent two different bindings. +
Similarly, `di.instance<List<String>>()` and `di.instance<List<Int>>()` will yield two different list.

[NOTE]
====
Since *7.0*, _Kodein-DI_ can use `generic` for non JVM platforms, thus it is now the default implementation.
However you still can force the use of `erased` with the generic and erased function forms!
====

== The JVM case

However, you should be aware that under the hood, this new type system uses the new function `typeOf()` from Kotlin, for every platforms, except for the JVM that still have it's own `generic` implementation.
Meaning that the JVM counterpart of the type system makes a heavy use of reflection, so it's _less optimized_.

[WARNING]
====
Yes, #perfmatters. However, the humble opinion of the author is that:

- There is a balance to be found between performance, readability, security and debuggability.
- Optimisation is important *in critical path*, not _everywhere_.
- _Kodein-DI_ is already pretty optimized ;)
- In the vast majority of cases, using the erased version will result in **no significant performance change** to your application, as IoC happens once and is not a performance pitfall!

Therefore, please make sure that, using the erased version is right for your use case, before blindly using it ;).
*Do profile your code*!
====

//The difference is very simple: the `generic` version is *NOT* subject to type erasure while the `erased` version *IS*.
//
//Of course, it is a little bit more complicated! +
//To be able to circumvent the type erasure that's inherent to the JVM bytecode, the `generic` version uses a trix that makes heavy use of reflexivity.
//Because the `erased` version does not use that trix, handling generic types in _Kodein-DI_ are a lot more complex to use.

//|=======
//| &nbsp;    | Type erasure | Optimized | Non-generic bindings | Generic bindings
//| *generic* | *immune*     | no        | *simple*             | *simple*
//| *erased*  | subject      | *yes*     | *simple*             | complex
//|=======
//
//On the JVM, you might prefer the erased version if:
//
//- You are confident you are not binding / injecting / retrieving generic types and you are sure *none of the libraries you are using are*.
//- You are not using <<set-bindings,set bindings>>.
//
//If you profile your code and find that injection is a performance pitfall, then it probably is instanciation: you are creating too many objects in critical paths.
//Reusing objects in critical paths will enhance performance both in dependency injection / retrieval and in GC!
//
//If you are using the `erased` version, either by choice on the JVM, or by default on JS & Native, you should read <<erased-version,erased version pitfalls>>.

NOTE: Even if by default _Kodein-DI_ uses a `generic` type system, you still can use the `erased` one manually. (see *TODO*)
