_Kodein-DI_ is a very useful dependency injection / retrieval container, it is very easy to use and configure.

._Kodein-DI_ allows you to:
- Lazily instantiate your dependencies when needed.
- Stop caring about dependency initialization order.
- Easily bind classes or interfaces to their instance, provider or factory.
- Easily debug your dependency bindings and recursions.

._Kodein-DI_ is a good choice because:
- It is small, fast and optimized (makes extensive use of `inline`).
- It proposes a very simple and readable declarative DSL.
- It is not subject to type erasure (like Java).
- It integrates nicely with Android.
- It proposes a very kotlin-esque idiomatic API.
- It can be used in plain Java.
