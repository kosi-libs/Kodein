== Introduction

=== Description

[.lead]
Kodein is a very useful dependency injection / retrieval container, it is very easy to use and configure.

.Kodein allows you to:
- Lazily instantiate your dependencies when needed.
- Stop caring about dependency initialization order.
- Easily bind classes or interfaces to their instance, provider or factory.
- Easily debug your dependency bindings and recursions.

.Kodein is a good choice because:
- It is small, fast and optimized (makes extensive use of `inline`).
- It proposes a very simple and readable declarative DSL.
- It is not subject to type erasure (like Java).
- It integrates nicely with Android.
- It proposes a very kotlin-esque idiomatic API.
- It can be used in plain Java.


=== Example

Kodein makes it very easy to bind a type:

[source,kotlin]
.Example bindings:
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with provider { RandomDice(0, 5) }
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----

Once bindings are declared, Kodein allows you to either inject or retrieve the dependencies for a class.

If you want your class to be unaware of dependency retrieval, then you can *inject* dependencies at construction:

[source,kotlin]
.Using Kodein's dependency injection via construction:
----
class Controller(private val ds: DataSource) {
    /*...*/
}
val controller by kodein.newInstance { Controller(instance()) }
----

If you want your class to handle it's dependencies by itself, then you can have it easily *retrieve* them:

[source,kotlin]
.Using Kodein's dependency injection via construction:
----
class Controller(override val kodein: Kodein): KodeinAware {
    private val ds: DataSource by instance()
}
----


== Platform compatibility & Genericity

Kodein is compatible with all platforms that the Kotlin language compiles to: JVM & compatible (Android), Javascript and all the Kotlin/Native targets.

On the JVM & compatible (Android), you need to choose to use either the `erased` or the `generic` version. +
On the Javascript and Native targets, only the `erased` version is available.

The difference is very simple: the `generic` version is *NOT* subject to type erasure while the `erased` version *IS*.

Of course, it is a little bit more complicated! +
To be able to circumvent the type erasure that's inherent to the JVM bytecode, the `generic` version uses a trix that makes heavy use of reflexivity.
Because the `erased` version does not use that trix, handling generic types in Kodein are a lot more complex to use.

[options="header"]
|=======
| &nbsp;    | Type erasure | Optimized | Non-generic bindings | Generic bindings
| *generic* | *immune*     | no        | *simple*             | *simple*
| *erased*  | subject      | *yes*     | *simple*             | complex

[WARNING]
====
Yes, #perfmatters. However, the humble opinion of the author is that:

- There is a balance to be found between performance, readability, security and debuggability.
- Optimisation is important *in critical path*, not _everywhere_.
- Kodein is already pretty optimized ;)
- In the vast majority of cases, using the erased version will result in **no significant performance change** to your application, as IoC happens once and is not a performance pitfall!

Therefore, please make sure that, using the erased version is right for your use case, before blindly using it ;).
*Do profile your code*!
====

On the JVM, you might prefer the erased version if:

- You are confident you are not binding / injecting / retrieving generic types and you are sure *none of the libraries you are using are*.
- You are not using <<set-bindings,set bindings>>.

If you profile your code and find that injection is a performance pitfall, then it probably is instanciation: you are creating too many objects in critical paths.
Reusing objects in critical paths will enhance performance both in dependency injection / retrieval and in GC!

If you are using the erased version, either by choice on the JVM, or by default on JS & Native, you should read <<erased-version,erased version pitfalls>>.


[[install]]
== Install

=== JVM

==== With Maven

Add the JCenter repository:

[source,xml,subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;jcenter&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://jcenter.bintray.com&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
----

Then add the dependency:

[source,xml,subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.kodein.di&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;kodein-di-generic-jvm&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;{version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
----

NOTE: Use `kodein-di-generic-jvm` or `kodein-di-erased-jvm`.


==== With Gradle

Add the JCenter repository:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
----

Then add the dependency:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-generic-jvm:{version}'
}
----

NOTE: Use `kodein-di-generic-jvm` or `kodein-di-erased-jvm`.


=== JavaScript (Gradle)

Because Kodein for JavaScript is compiled as a https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD module], it can be imported:

* In a browser:
** as an AMD module (for example with RequireJS) (See index.html in the demo project).
** Directly in an HTML page with a `<script>` tag (See index2.html in the demo project).
* In NodeJS, as a regular CJS module.

Add the JCenter repository:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
----

Then add the dependency:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    compile 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-erased-js:{version}'
}
----


=== Native (Gradle)

NOTE: Kodein supports the following targets: +
      androidArm32, androidArm64, iosArm32, iosArm64, iosX64, linuxArm32Hfp, linuxMips32, linuxMipsel32, linuxX64, macosX64, mingwX64

Kodein-DI uses the new gradle native dependency model.
Because that model is experimental in gradle, it is not forward compatible with next versions of Gradle.

Add the JCenter repository:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
----

Then add the dependency:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation "org.kodein.di:kodein-di-erased:{version}"
            }
        }
    }
}
----


[[declaring-dependencies]]
== Bindings: Declaring dependencies

[source,kotlin]
.Example: initialization of a Kodein container
----
val kodein = Kodein {
	/* Bindings */
}
----

Bindings are declared inside a Kodein initialization block.

NOTE: If you are using `kodein-di-generic-jvm`, Kodein *not* subject to type erasure (e.g. You can bind both a `List<Int>` and a `List<String>`).

CAUTION: This is *NOT* the case when using `kodein-di-erased-jvm`, `kodein-erased-js` or `kodein-erased-native`.
         With the `erased` version by default, binding `List<Int>` and `List<String>` actually means binding `List<*>` twice.

A binding always starts with `bind<TYPE>() with`.

[.lead]
There are different ways to declare bindings:


[[tagged-bindings]]
=== Tagged bindings

All bindings can be tagged to allow you to bind different instances of the same type.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: different Dice bindings
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with ... // <1>
    bind<Dice>(tag = "DnD10") with ... // <2>
    bind<Dice>(tag = "DnD20") with ... // <2>
}
----
<1> Default binding (with no tag)
<2> Bindings with tags (`"DnD10"` and `"DnD20"`)

TIP: The tag is of type `Any`, it does not have to be a `String`.

TIP: Whether at define, at injection or at retrieval, `tag` should always be passed as a named argument.

IMPORTANT: Tag objects must support equality & hashcode comparison.
           It is therefore recommended to either use primitives (Strings, Ints, etc.) or data classes.


=== Provider binding

This binds a type to a provider function, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns an object of the bound type (eg. `() -> T`). +
The provided function will be called *each time* you need an instance of the bound type.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new 6 sided Dice entry each time you need one
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with provider { RandomDice(6) }
}
----


=== Singleton binding

This binds a type to an instance of this type that will lazily be created at first use via a singleton function, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns an object of the bound type (eg. `() -> T`). +
Therefore, the provided function will be called *only once*: the first time an instance is needed.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a DataSource singleton that will be initialized on first access
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----


==== Non-synced singleton

By definition, there can be only one instance of a singleton, which means only one instance can be constructed.
To achieve this certainty, Kodein synchronizes construction.
This means that, when a singleton instance is requested and not available, Kodein uses a synchronization mutex to ensure that other request to the same type will wait for this instance to be constructed.

While this behaviour is the only way to ensure the singleton's correctness, it is also costly (due to the mutex) and degrades startup performance.

If you need to improve startup performance, _if you know what you are doing_, you can disable this synchronization.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a DataSource non synced singleton
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton(sync = false) { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----

Using `sync = false` means that:

- There will be no construction synchronicity.
- There _may_ be multiple instance constructed.
- Instance will be _reused_ as much as possible.


==== Eager singleton

This is the same as a regular singleton, except that the provided function will be called as soon as the Kodein instance is created and all bindings are defined.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a DataSource singleton that will be initialized as soon as the binding block ends
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    // The SQLite connection will be opened as soon as the kodein instance is ready
    bind<DataSource>() with eagerSingleton { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----


=== Factory binding

This binds a type to a factory function, which is a function that takes an argument of a defined type and that returns an object of the bound type (eg. `(A) -> T`). +
The provided function will be called *each time* you need an instance of the bound type.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new Dice each time you need one, according to an Int representing the number of sides
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { sides: Int -> RandomDice(sides) }
}
----


[[multi-argument-factories]]
==== Multi-arguments factories

CAUTION: This multi-agrument-factories mechanism is deprecated and will be removed in version `7.0`

A factory can take multiple (up to 5) arguments:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new Dice each time you need one, according to an Int representing the number of sides
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { startNumber: Int, sides: Int -> RandomDice(sides) }
}
----

NOTE: We recommand to use `data classes` instead!

Regarding our users feedbacks, we find out that multi-arguments factories was difficult to use.

Thus this mechanism will be deprecate soon. So we highly recommend that you migrate your multi-args factories to simple factories by using *data classes*.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new Dice each time you need one, according to multiple parameters
----
data class DiceParams(val startNumber: Int, val sides: Int)

val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { params: DiceParams -> RandomDice(params) }
}
----


=== Multiton binding

A multiton can be thought of a "singleton factory": it guarantees to always return the same object given the same argument.
In other words, for a given argument, the first time a multiton is called with this argument, it will call the function to create an instance; and will always yield that same instance when called with the same argument.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates one random generator for each value
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<RandomGenerator>() with multiton { max: Int -> SecureRandomGenerator(max) }
}
----

Just like a factory, a multiton can take multiple (up to 5) arguments.

==== non-synced multiton

Just like a singleton, a multiton synchronization can be disabled:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: non-synced multiton
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<RandomGenerator>(sync = false) with multiton { max: Int -> SecureRandomGenerator(max) }
}
----


=== Referenced singleton or multiton binding

A referenced singleton is an object that is guaranteed to be single as long as a reference object can return it.
A referenced multiton is an object that is guaranteed to be single for the same argument as long as a reference object can return it.

A referenced singleton or multiton needs a "reference maker" in addition to the classic construction function that determines the type of reference that will be used.

[.lead]
Kodein comes with three reference makers for the JVM:


==== JVM: Soft & weak

These are objects that are guaranteed to be single in the JVM at a given time, but not guaranteed to be single during the application lifetime.
If there are no more strong references to the instances, they may be GC'd and later, re-created.

Therefore, the provided function *may or may not* be called multiple times during the application lifetime.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a Cache object that will exist only once at a given time
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Map>() with singleton(ref = softReference) { WorldMap() } <1>
    bind<Client>() with singleton(ref = weakReference) { id -> clientFromDB(id) } <2>
}
----
<1> Because it's bound by a soft reference, the JVM will GC it before any `OutOfMemoryException` can occur.
<2> Because it's bound by a weak reference, the JVM will GC it is no more referenced.

Weak singletons use JVM's `WeakReference` while soft singletons use JVM's `SoftReference`.


==== JVM: Thread local

This is the same as the standard singleton binding, except that each thread gets a different instance.
Therefore, the provided function will be called *once per thread* that needs the instance, the first time it is requested.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a Cache object that will exist once per thread
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Cache>() with singleton(ref = threadLocal) { LRUCache(16 * 1024) }
}
----

NOTE: Semantically, thread local singletons should use <<scoped-singletons>>, the reason it uses a referenced singleton is because Java's `ThreadLocal` acts like a reference.

CAUTION: Thread locals are not available in JavaScript.


=== Instance binding

This binds a type to an instance that *already exist*.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: a DataSource binding to an already existing instance.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<DataSource>() with instance(SqliteDataSource.open("path/to/file")) // <1>
}
----
<1> Instance is used *with parenthesis*: it is not given a function, but an instance.


[[constant-binding]]
==== Constant binding

It is often useful to bind "configuration" constants.

NOTE: Constants are always <<tagged-bindings,tagged>>.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: two constants
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    constant(tag = "maxThread") with 8 // <1>
    constant(tag = "serverURL") with "https://my.server.url" // <1>
}
----
<1> Note the absence of curly braces: it is not given a function, but an instance.

CAUTION: You should only use constant bindings for very simple types without inheritance or interface (e.g. primitive types and data classes).


=== Direct binding

Sometimes, it may seem overkill to specify the type to `bind` if you are binding the same type as you are creating.

For this use case, you can transform any `bind<Type>() with ...` to `bind() from ...`.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: direct bindings
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind() from singleton { RandomDice(6) }
    bind("DnD20") from provider { RandomDice(20) }
    bind() from instance(SqliteDataSource.open("path/to/file"))
}
----

CAUTION: *This should be used with care* as binding a concrete class and, therefore, having concrete dependencies is an _anti-pattern_ that later prevents modularisation and mocking / testing.

WARNING: When using `kodein-generic-*` and binding a generic type, the bound type will be the specialized type, +
         e.g. `bind() from singleton { listOf(1, 2, 3, 4) }` registers the binding to `List<Int>`.

NOTE: If you are using Kodein/Native, because of https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/1290[this bug], you need to use the uppercase version: `Bind() from`.
      This issue has been fixed and the `bind() from` syntax will be available to Kodein/Native as soon as Kotlin/Native 0.6 is released.


=== Subtypes bindings

Kodein allows you register a "subtype bindings factory".
These are big words for a simple concept that's best explained with an example:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: direct bindings
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Controller>().subtypes() with { type ->
        when (type.jvmType) { <1>
            MySpecialController::class.java -> singleton { MySpecialController() }
            else -> provider { myControllerSystem.getController(type.jvmType) }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> As `type` is a `TypeToken<*>`, you can use `.jvmType` to get the JVM type (e.g. `Class` or `ParameterizedType`).

In essence, `bind<Whatever>().subtypes() with { type -> binding }` allows you to register, in Kodein, a binding factory that will be called for subtypes of the provided type.


=== Transitive dependencies

With those lazily instantiated dependencies, a dependency (very) often needs another dependency.
Such classes can have their dependencies passed to their constructor.
Thanks to Kotlin's _killer_ type inference engine, Kodein makes retrieval of transitive dependencies really easy.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a class that needs transitive dependencies
----
class Dice(private val random: Random, private val sides: Int) {
/*...*/
}
----

It is really easy to bind this `RandomDice` with its transitive dependencies, by simply using `instance()` or `instance(tag)`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: bindings of a Dice and of its transitive dependencies
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with singleton { Dice(instance(), instance(tag = "max")) } // <1>

    bind<Random>() with provider { SecureRandom() } // <2>
    constant(tag "max") with 5 // <2>
}
----
<1> Binding of `Dice`. It gets its transitive dependencies by using `instance()` and `instance(tag)`.
<2> Bindings of `Dice` transitive dependencies.

NOTE: The order in which the bindings are declared has *no importance whatsoever*.

The binding functions are in the same environment as the `newInstance` function described in the <<injection, dependency injection section>>.
You can read it to learn more about the `instance`, `provider` and `factory` functions available to the function.


==== Transitive factory dependencies

Maybe you need a dependency to use one of its functions to create the bound type.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using a DataSource to create a Connection.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton { MySQLDataSource() }
    bind<Connection>() with provider { instance<DataSource>().openConnection() } <1>
}
----
<1> Using a `DataSource` as a transitive factory dependency.


=== Being responsible for its own retrieval

If the bound class is <<kodein-aware,KodeinAware>>, you can pass the `kodein` object to the class so it can itself use the Kodein container to retrieve its own dependencies.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: bindings of Manager that is responsible for retrieving its own dependencies
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Manager>() with singleton { ManagerImpl(kodein) } // <1>
}
----
<1> ManagerImpl is given a Kodein instance.


== Bindings separation

=== Modules

==== Definition

Kodein allows you to export your bindings in modules.
It is very useful to have separate modules defining their own bindings instead of having only one central binding definition.
A module is an object that you can construct the exact same way as you construct a Kodein instance.


[source, kotlin]
.Example: a simple module
----
val apiModule = Kodein.Module(name = "API") {
    bind<API>() with singleton { APIImpl() }
    /* other bindings */
}
----

Then, in your Kodein binding block:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports the module
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    import(apiModule)
    /* other bindings */
}
----

NOTE: Modules are *definitions*, they will re-declare their bindings in each Kodein instance you use.
      If you create a module that defines a singleton and import that module into two different Kodein instances, then the singleton object will exist twice: once in each Kodein instance.


[[module-uniqueness]]
==== Name uniqueness

Each module name should only be imported once.

If a second module with the name of an already imported module is imported, then Kodein will fail.

However, you cannot always ensure that every module name is unique: you may need to import modules that are defined outside of your code.
Kodein offers two ways to mitigate that:

1. Rename a module: +
   Use when you are importing a module whose name already exists.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports a renamed module
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    import(apiModule.copy(name = "otherAPI"))
}
----
+
2. Add a prefix to modules imported by a module: +
   Use when a module imported by another module uses a names which already exists.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports a module with a prefix for sub-modules
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    import(apiModule.copy(prefix = "otherAPI-"))
}
----


==== Import once

You may define a module which you know depends on another module, so it would be great to import that dependency inside the module that has the dependency.
However, each module can only be imported once, so if every module that depends on another module imports it, Kodein will fail at the second module that imports it.

To support this, Kodein offers `importOnce`: it imports the module if no module with that name was previously imported.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: importing a module only once
----
val appModule = Kodein.Module {
    importOnce(apiModule)
}
----


=== Extension (composition)

Kodein allows you to create a new Kodein instance by extending an existing one.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: extends an already existing Kodein instance
----
val subKodein = Kodein {
    extend(appKodein)
    /* other bindings */
}
----

NOTE: This *preserves bindings*, meaning that a singleton in the parent Kodein will continue to exist only once.
      Both parent and child Kodein objects will give the same instance.


=== Overriding

By default, overriding a binding is not allowed in Kodein.
That is because accidentally binding twice the same (class,tag) to different instances/providers/factories can cause real headaches to debug.

However, when intended, it can be really interesting to override a binding, especially when creating a testing environment.
You can override an existing binding by specifying explicitly that it is an override.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binds twice the same type, the second time explitly specifying an override
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<API>() with singleton { APIImpl() }
    /* ... */
    bind<API>(overrides = true) with singleton { OtherAPIImpl() }
}
----

By default, *modules are not allowed to override, _even explicitly_*.
You can allow a module to override some of your bindings when you import it (the same goes for extension):

[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports a module and giving it the right to override existing bindings.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    /* ... */
    import(testEnvModule, allowOverride = true)
}
----

WARNING: The bindings in the module still need to specify explicitly the overrides.

Sometimes, you just want to define bindings without knowing if you are actually overriding a previous binding or defining a new.
Those cases should be rare and you should know what you are doing.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: declaring a module in which each binding may or may not override existing bindings.
----
val testModule = Kodein.Module(name = "test", allowSilentOverride = true) {
    bind<EmailClient>() with singleton { MockEmailClient() } <1>
}
----
<1> Maybe adding a new binding, maybe overriding an existing one, who knows?

If you want to access an instance retrieved by the overridden binding, you can use overriddenInstance.
This is useful if you want to "enhance" a binding (for example, using the decorator pattern).

[source,kotlin]
.Example: declaring a module in which each binding may or may not override existing bindings.
----
val testModule = Kodein.Module(name = "test") {
    bind<Logger>(overrides = true) with singleton { FileLoggerWrapper("path/to/file", overriddenInstance()) } <1>
}
----
<1> `overriddenInstance()` will return the `Logger` instance retrieved by the overridden binding.


[#overridden_access_from_parent]
=== Overridden access from parent

Let's consider the following code :

[source,kotlin]
.Example: Mixing overriding & extension
----
val parent = Kodein {
    bind<Foo>() with provider { Foo1() }
    bind<Bar>() with singleton { Bar(foo = instance<Foo>()) }
}

val child = Kodein {
    extend(parent)
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo2() }
}

val foo = child.instance<Bar>().foo
----

In this example, the `foo` variable will be of type `Foo1`.
Because the `Bar` binding is a `singleton` and is declared in the `parent` Kodein, it *does not have access to bindings declared in `child`.*
In this example, both `parent.instance<Bar>().foo` and `child.instance<Bar>().foo` will yield a `Foo1` object.

NOTE: This is because `Bar` is bound to a `singleton`, the first access would define the container used (`parent` or `child`).
If the singleton were initialized by `child`, then a subsequent access from `parent` would yeild a `Bar` with a reference to a `Foo2`, which is not supposed to exist in `parent`.

IMPORTANT: By default, *all bindings that do not cache instances* (basically all bindings but `singleton` and `multiton`) *are copied by default into the new container*, and therefore have access to the bindings & overrides of this new container.

If you want the `Bar` singleton to have access to the overridden `Foo` binding, you need to copy it into the `child` container.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying the bar binding into the child container
----
val child = Kodein {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy {
        copy the binding<Bar>() <1>
    })
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo2() }
}
----

CAUTION: Copying a binding means that it will exists once more.
Therefore, a copied singleton will *no longer be unique* and have TWO instances, one managed by each binding (the original and the copied).

If the binding you need to copy is bound by a context (such as a scoped singleton), you need to specify it:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying a tagged scoped singleton
----
val parent = Kodein {
    bind<Session>(tag = "req") with scoped(requestScope).singleton { context.session() }
}

val child = Kodein {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy {
        copy the binding<Session>() with scope(requestScope) and tag("req")
    })
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo2() }
}
----

NOTE: You can use the `context<>()`, `scope()` and `tag()` functions to specialise your binding copies.

You can also copy all bindings that matches a particular definition :

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying all that matches
----
val child = Kodein {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy {
        copy all binding<String>() <1>
        copy all scope(requestScope) <2>
    })
}
----
<1> Will copy all bindings for a `String`, with or without a context, scope, tag or argument.
<2> Will copy all bindings that are scoped inside a `RequestScope`.

Finally, you can simply copy *all* bindings:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying all
----
val child = Kodein {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy.All)
}
----

Or you can decide that none are copied (if you do want existing bindings to have access to new bindings):

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying none
----
val child = Kodein {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy.None)
}
----


== Dependency injection & retrieval

[source, kotlin]
.Example bindings that are used throughout the chapter:
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { sides: Int -> RandomDice(sides) }
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
    bind<Random>() with provider { SecureRandom() }
    bind<FileAccess>() with factory { path: String, mode: Int -> FileAccess.open(path, mode) }
    constant("answer") with "fourty-two"
}
----


=== Retrieval rules

.When retrieving a dependency, the following rules apply:
* A dependency bound with a `provider`, an `instance`, a `singleton`, an `eagerSingleton`, or a `constant` can be retrieved:
** as a provider method: `() -> T`
** as an instance: `T`
* A dependency bound with a `factory` or a `multiton` can only be retrieved as a factory method: `(A) -> T`.
** as a factory method: `(A) -> T`
** as a provider method: `() -> T` _if the argument `A` is provided at retrieval_.
** as an instance: `T` _if the argument `A` is provided at retrieval_.


=== Injection & Retrieval

When dependencies are *injected*, the class is _provided_ its dependencies at construction. +
When dependencies are *retrieved*, the class is _responsible_ for getting its own dependencies.

Using dependency *injection* is a bit more cumbersome, but your classes are "pure": they are unaware of the dependency container.
Using dependency *retrieval* is easier (and allows more tooling), but it does binds your classes to the Kodein API.

Finally, in retrieval, *everything is lazy by default*, while there can be no lazy-loading using injection.

TIP: If you are developing a library, then you probably should use dependency *injection*, to avoid forcing the users of your library to use Kodein as well. +
     If you are developing an application, then you should consider using dependency *retrieval*, as it is easier to use and provides more tooling.


==== Base methods

Whether you are using dependency injection or retrieval, the same 3 methods will be available with the same name and parameters (but not return type). +
These methods are:

- `instance()` if you need an instance: `T`.
- `provider()` if you need a provider: `() -> T`.
- `factory()` if you need an instance: `(A) -> T`.

All three methods can take a `tag` argument.

[TIP]
====
The `tag` argument should always be named.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Using the named tag argument.
----
instance(tag = "whatever").
----
====


[[injection]]
=== Injection

To use dependency injection,

1. Declare your dependencies in the constructor of your classes.
2. Use Kodein's `newInstance` method to create an object of such class.


==== Simple case

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a MainController class with a 2 dependencies constructor.
----
class MainController(val ds: DataSource, val rnd: Random) { /*...*/ }
----

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Creating a MainController by injecting its dependencies.
----
val controller by kodein.newInstance { MainController(instance(), instance(tag = "whatever")) } <1>
----
<1> Note the use of the `instance` function that will inject the correct dependency.

WARNING: When injecting a type that was not bound, a `Kodein.NotFoundException` will be thrown.

If you are not sure (or simply do not know) if the type has been bound, you can use `*OrNull` methods.


==== Multi-arguments factories

When injecting a value that was bound with a <<multi-argument-factories,multi-argument factory>>,
the arguments must be wrapped inside a *data class*:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Creating a FileController by injecting a multi-argument bound dependency.
----
data class ControllerParams(val path: String, val timeout: Int)
val controller by kodein.newInstance { FileController(instance(args = ControllerParams("path/to/file", 0))) }
----


==== Currying factories

You can retrieve a provider or an instance from a factory bound type by using the `arg` parameter (this is called _currying_).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a RollController class with a constructor dependency bound to a factory.
----
class RollController(val dice: Dice) { /*...*/ }
----

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Creating a RollController by injecting its dependency.
----
val controller by kodein.newInstance { RollController(instance(arg = 6)) }
----

Note that if you want to bind a factory with multiple argument, you need to use a *data class* to pass multiple arguments:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Creating a multi-argument RollController by injecting its dependency.
----
data class Params(val arg1: Int, val arg2: Int)
val controller by kodein.newInstance { RollController(instance(arg = Params(60, 6))) }
----

TIP: The `arg` argument should always be named.


==== Defining context

When retrieving, you sometimes need to manually define a context (for example, when retrieving a scoped singleton).
For this, you can use the `on` method:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Setting a global context.
----
val controller by kodein.on(context = myContext).newInstance { OtherController(instance(arg = 6), instance()) }
----

TIP: The `context` argument should always be named.

Sometimes, the context is not available directly at construction.
When that happens, you can define a lazy context that will be accessed only when needed.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Setting a global context.
----
val controller by kodein.on { requireActivity() } .newInstance { OtherController(instance(arg = 6), instance()) }
----



=== Retrieval: the Kodein container

==== everything is lazy by default!

In the next few sections, we will be describing dependency retrieval.
As you might have guessed by the title of this section, everything, in dependency retrieval, is lazy by default.

This allows:

- Dependencies to be retrieved only when they are actually needed.
- "Out of context" classes such as Android Activities to access their dependencies once their contexts have been initialized.

If you want "direct" retrieval, well, there's a section named <<direct-retrieval,direct retrieval>>, how about that!


==== Kodein methods

You can retrieve a bound type via a Kodein instance.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving bindings
----
val diceFactory: (Int) -> Dice by kodein.factory()
val dataSource: DataSource by kodein.instance()
val randomProvider: () -> Random by kodein.provider()
val answerConstant: String by kodein.instance(tag = "answer")
----

Note the use of the `by`.
Kodein uses https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html::[delegated properties] to enable:

- Lazy loading
- Accessing the receiver

NOTE: When using a provider function (`() -> T`), whether this function will give each time a new instance or the same depends on the binding.

WARNING: When asking for a type that was not bound, a `Kodein.NotFoundException` will be thrown.

If you are not sure (or simply do not know) if the type has been bound, you can use `*OrNull` methods.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving bindings that may not have been bound
----
val diceFactory: ((Int) -> Dice)? by kodein.factoryOrNull()
val dataSource: DataSource? by kodein.instanceOrNull()
val randomProvider: (() -> Random)? by kodein.providerOrNull()
val answerConstant: String? by kodein.instanceOrNull(tag = "answer")
----


==== Constants

If you bound <<constant-binding,constants>>, you can easily retrieve them with the constant method if the name of the property matches the tag:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving a constant
----
val answer: String by kodein.constant()
----


==== Named bindings

If you used <<tagged-bindings,tagged bindings>>, if the tag is a `String` and the property name matches the tag, instead of passing it as argument, you can use `named`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving a named binding
----
val answer: String by kodein.named.instance()
----


==== Multi-arguments factories

When retrieving a value that was bound with a <<multi-argument-factories,multi-argument factory>>, the arguments must be wrapped inside a *data class*:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Creating a MainController by injecting a multi-argument bound dependency.
----
data class FileParams(val path: String, val maxSize: Int)
val fileAccess: FileAccess by kodein.instance(args = FileParams("/path/to/file", 0))
----

===== Factory retrieval

Instead of retrieving a value, you can retrieve a factory, that can call as much as you need.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving factory.
----
val f1: (Int) -> Int by kodein.factory() <1>
----
<1> retrieving a factory that takes 1 argument (Int) and return an Int

==== Currying factories

You can retrieve a provider or an instance from a factory bound type by using the `arg` parameter (this is called _currying_).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: currying factories
----
val sixSideDiceProvider: () -> Dice by kodein.provider(arg = 6)
val twentySideDice: Dice by kodein.instance(arg = 20)
----

Note that if you bound a factory with multiple arguments, you need to use a *data class* to pass multiple arguments:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Creating a multi-argument Dice by injecting its dependency.
----
data class DiceParams(val startNumber: Int, val sides: Int)
val sixtyToSixtySixDice: Dice by kodein.instance(arg = DiceParams(60, 6)) <1>
----
<1> Bonus points if you can say the variable name 5 times in less than 5 seconds ;)

TIP: The `arg` argument should always be named.


==== Defining context

Whether you are using a scoped singleton/multiton or using a context in the target binding, you may need to specify a context.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Getting a Session after setting the Request context.
----
val session: Session by kodein.on(context = request).instance()
----

If you retrieve multiple dependencies all using the same context, you can create a new `Kodein` object with the context set:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: creating a Kodein object with the Request context.
----
val reqKodein = kodein.on(context = request)
val session: Session by reqKodein.instance()
----

TIP: The `context` argument should always be named.

NOTE: Using a global context does not forces you to use only bindings that are declared with this type of context.
      Because the default context is `Any?`, all non-contexted bindings will still be available with a global context set.


==== Using a Trigger

There is a mechanism that allows you to decide when dependencies are actually retrieved if you want them to be retrieved at a particular time and not at first access.
This mechanism is called a Trigger.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using a trigger.
----
val trigger = KodeinTrigger()
val dice: Dice by kodein.on(trigger = trigger).instance()
/*...*/
trigger.trigger() <1>
----
<1> Retrieval happens now.

You can, of course, assign multiple properties to the same trigger.
You can also create a Kodein object that has a given trigger by default:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: creating a Kodein object with a trigger.
----
val trigger = KodeinTrigger()
val injectKodein = kodein.on(trigger = trigger)
val dice: Dice by injectKodein.instance()
/*...*/
trigger.trigger()
----

TIP: The `trigger` argument should always be named.

NOTE: A trigger allows you to "force" retrieval.
      However, retrieval can still happen before `inject()` is called if the variable is accessed.


==== Lazy access

Kodein proposes a `LazyKodein` object that allows you to lazily access the Kodein object only when needed.
This is useful if:

- You need to defined a lazily retrieved dependency before having access to a Kodein container.
- You don't know if you'll ever need to access a Kodein object.

For this, you can use a `LazyKodein`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Using a LazyKodein.
----
val kodein = LazyKodein { /* access to a kodein instance */ }
val ds: DataSource by kodein.instance()
/*...*/
dice.roll() <1>
----
<1> Only then will the Kodein instance will itself be retrieved.

Note that you can also lazily create a `Kodein` object so that the bindings definition function will only be called when the first retrieved property is needed:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Using a lazy Kodein.
----
val kodein by Kodein.lazy {
    bind<Env>() with instance(Env.getInstance())
}
val env: Env by kodein.instance()
/*...*/
env.doSomething() <1>
----
<1> Only then will the Kodein instance will itself be created, and the bindings definition function ran.


==== Late init

Kodein proposes a `LateInitKodein` that allows you to define a Kodein object _after_ some lazy retrieval:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Using a LateInitKodein.
----
val kodein = LateInitKodein()
val env: Env by kodein.instance()
/*...*/
kodein.baseKodein = /* access to a kodein instance */ <1>
/*...*/
env.doSomething() <2>
----
<1> Setting the real Kodein object.
<2> If this was run before setting `kodein.baseKodein`, an `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` would be thrown.


==== All matches

Kodein allows you to retrieve all instances that matches a given type:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: all instances of Foo.
----
val instances: List<Foo> by kodein.allInstances() <1>
----
<1> Will return all instances that are for bindings of sub-classes of `Foo`

NOTE: Of course, `allProviders` and `allFactories` are also provided ;)


[[kodein-aware]]
=== Retrieval: being KodeinAware

==== Simple retrieval

You can have classes that implement the interface `KodeinAware`. +
Doing so has the benefit of getting a simpler syntax for retrieval.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a KodeinAware class
----
class MyManager(override val kodein: Kodein) : KodeinAware {
    private val diceFactory: ((Int) -> Dice)? by factoryOrNull()
    private val dataSource: DataSource? by instanceOrNull()
    private val randomProvider: (() -> Random)? by providerOrNull()
    private val answerConstant: String? by instanceOrNull(tag = "answer")
    private val sixSideDiceProvider: () -> Dice by kodein.provider(arg = 6)
    private val twentySideDice: Dice by kodein.instance(arg = 20)
}
----

All methods that are available to the Kodein container are available to a `KodeinAware` class.


==== Class global context

In a `KodeinAware` class, to define a context that's valid for the entire class, you can simply override the `kodeinContext` property:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a KodeinAware class with a context
----
class MyManager(override val kodein: Kodein) : KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinContext = kcontext(whatever) <1>
    /*...*/
}
----
<1> Note the use of the `kcontext` function that creates a `KodeinContext` with the given value.

NOTE: Using a global context does not forces you to use only bindings that are declared with this type of context.
      Because the default context is `Any?`, all non-contexted bindings will still be available with a global context set.

Sometimes, the context is not available directly at construction.
When that happens, you can define a lazy context that will be accessed only when needed.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a KodeinAware class with a context
----
class MyManager(override val kodein: Kodein) : KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinContext = kcontext { requireActivity }
    /*...*/
}
----


==== Class global trigger

If you want to have all dependency properties retrieved at once, you can use a class global trigger.
Simply override the `kodeinTrigger` property:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a KodeinAware class with a trigger
----
class MyManager(override val kodein: Kodein) : KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinTrigger = KodeinTrigger()
    val ds: DataSource by instance()
    /*...*/
    fun onReady() {
        kodeinTrigger.trigger() <1>
    }
}
----
<1> Retrieval of all dependencies happens now.


==== Lazy access

Some classes (such as Android Activities) do not have access to a `Kodein` instance at the time of construction, but only later when they have been properly connected to their environment (Android context). +
Because Kodein is lazy by default, this does not cause any issue: simply have the kodein property be lazy by itself:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: an Activity class with a lazy-loaded kodein
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), KodeinAware {
    override val kodein by lazy { (applicationContext as MyApplication).kodein }
    val ds: DataSource by instance() <1>
}
----
<1> Because `ds` is lazily retrieved, access to the `kodein` property will only happen at first retrieval.

NOTE: There is an official module to ease the use of Kodein in Android, you can read more about it on xref:framework:android.adoc[the dedicated document].


==== Lateinit

Because everything is lazy and, in a KodeinAware class, the Kodein object is not accessed until needed, you can easily declare the `kodein` field as lateinit.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: an Activity class with a lateinit kodein
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), KodeinAware {
    override val lateinit kodein: Kodein
    val ds: DataSource by instance() <1>
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        kodein = (applicationContext as MyApplication).kodein
    }
}
----
<1> Because `ds` is lazily retrieved, access to the `kodein` property will only happen at first retrieval.


==== All matches

Kodein allows you to retrieve all instances that matches a given type:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: all instances of Foo.
----
val instances: List<Foo> = dkodein.allInstances() <1>
----
<1> Will return all instances that are for bindings of sub-classes of `Foo`

NOTE: Of course, `allProviders` and `allFactories` are also provided ;)


[[direct-retrieval]]
=== Retrieval: Direct

If you don't want to use delegated properties, Kodein has you covered.
Most of the features available to `Kodein` are available to `DKodein` (D is for Direct).
`DKodein` allows you to directly get a new instance or dependency.

However, because it is direct, `DKodein` does *NOT* feature:

- Laziness: the instance/provider/factory is fetched at call time.
- Receiver awareness: receiver is defined by the Kotlin's delegated properties mechanism.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using a DKodein
----
val dk = kodein.direct

val ds: Datasource = dk.instance()

val controller = dk.newInstance { MainController(instance(), instance(tag = "whatever")) }
----

[TIP]
====
If you only plan to use direct access, you can define your main kodein object to be a `DKodein`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using a DKodein
----
val kodein = Kodein.direct { <1>
        /* bindings */
    }
----
<1>: Note the `.direct`.
====


==== Being DKodeinAware

Much like `Kodein` offers `KodeinAware`, `DKodein` offers `DKodeinAware`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a DKodeinAware class
----
class MyManager(override val dkodein: DKodein) : DKodeinAware {
    private val diceFactory: ((Int) -> Dice)? = factoryOrNull()
    private val dataSource: DataSource? = instanceOrNull()
    private val randomProvider: (() -> Random)? = providerOrNull()
    private val answerConstant: String? = instanceOrNull(tag = "answer")
    private val sixSideDiceProvider: () -> Dice = kodein.provider(arg = 6)
    private val twentySideDice: Dice = kodein.instance(arg = 20)
}
----


==== In Java

While Kodein does not allow you to declare modules or dependencies in Java, it does allow you to retrieve dependencies via `DKodein`.
Simply give the DKodein instance to your Java classes, use Kodein in Java with the `TT` static function:

[source, java]
.Example: using Kodein in Java
----
import static org.kodein.di.TypesKt.TT;

public class JavaClass {
    private final Function1<Integer, Dice> diceFactory;
    private final Datasource dataSource;
    private final Function0<Random> randomProvider;
    private final String answerConstant;

    public JavaClass(DKodein kodein) {
        diceFactory = kodein.Factory(TT(Integer.class), TT(Dice.class), null);
        dataSource = kodein.Instance(TT(Datasource.class), null);
        randomProvider = kodein.Provider(TT(Random.class), null);
        answerConstant = kodein.Instance(TT(String.class), "answer");
    }}
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember that Java is subject to type erasure.
Therefore, if you registered a generic Class binding such as `bind<List<String>>()`, in order to retrieve it you have to use `TypeReference` to circumvent Java's type erasure.

[source, java]
.Example: using TypeReference in Java
----
class JavaClass {
    private final List<String> list;

    public JavaClass(TKodein kodein) {
        list = kodein.Instance(TT(new TypeReference<List<String>>() {}), null);
    }
}
----
====


=== Error messages

By default, Kodein error messages contains the classes simple names (e.g. `View`), which makes it easily readable. +
If you want the error to contain classes full names (e.g. `com.company.app.UserController.View`), you can set `fullDescriptionOnError`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: showing qualified names in errors
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    fullDescriptionOnError = true
}
----

If you are using multiple Kodein instances, you can set the default value `fullDescriptionOnError` for all subsequently created Kodein instances:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: showing qualified names in all kodein instances errors
----
Kodein.defaultFullDescriptionOnError = true
----

CAUTION: `Kodein.defaultFullDescriptionOnError` must be set *before* creating a Kodein instance.


== Using the environment

Binding functions have access to the environment where the bound type is retrieved to be able to create it accordingly.

=== Context

[.lead]
This environment is represented as a *context* variable.

The context is an object that is explicitly defined by the programmer for this retrieval or the receiving object when none is explicitely defined.

There are two very important differences between a tag and a context:

- The tag *instance* identifies the binding but can not be used in the binding function.
- The context *type* identifies the binding and it's *instance* can be used in the binding function.

There are also two very important differences between a factory argument and a context:

- The context is defined _before_ retrieving the binding function while the factory argument is the last known variable.
- A context is usually global to an entire class while a factory argument is local to a retrieval.

TIP: When in doubt, use a factory with an argument instead of a provider with a context.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding in a context
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Writer>() with contexted<Request>.provider { context.response.writer } <1>
}
----
<1> note that `context` is already of type `Request`.


=== Scope

[NOTE]
====
Kodein provides only 1 scope by default, but:

- It is easy to create your own scopes.
- All `kodein-framework-*` modules provide more scopes that are specific to the target framework.
====

Scopes are derived from a context variable.
They allow a singleton or multiton objects to exist multiple times in different contexts. +
They are of type `Scope<C>` where `C` is the context type.

Think, for example, of a session object inside a web server.
We can say that there can be only one user per session, and therefore define a `User` singleton scoped in a session.
Therefore, the provided function will be called *once per session*.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding a User in a Session scope.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<User>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { UserData(session.userId) } <1>
}
----
<1> note that `SessionScope` does not really exist, it is an example.

In this example, `SessionScope` is of type `Scope<Session>`, so to access this binding, the user will either have retrieve it inside the session object or explicitly define a `Session` context:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding in a context
----
val user by kodein.on(session).instance()
----

NOTE: Please read the <<scope-creation>> section if you want to create your own scopes.


[[scope-closeable]]
==== Scope closeable

By default, a Singleton or a Multiton value will never expire.
However, the purpose of a Scope is to handle the lifecycle of a long lived value.
Therefore, it is possible for a scoped Singleton or Multiton value to expire (most of the time because the scope itself expires).
For example, in android's `ActivityRetainedScope`, scoped values will only live the duration of the activity.

If a value implements `ScopeCloseable`, it's `close` function will be called when the value is removed from the scope (or when the scope itself expires).

[CAUTION]
====
The `ScopeCloseable.close` method will only be called:

- By scopes that explicitely *support* that feature (not all scopes do, all scopes provided by the Kodein Framework do *except WeakContextScope*).
- If the value does *not* use `WeakRef` or `SoftRef` references. +
  If the value does, the close method _may or may not_ be called (it will be called if the reference has not expired).
====


==== JVM references in scopes

Yes, you can...

[source, kotlin]
.Example: JVM scoped weak references.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<User>() with scoped(requestScope).singleton(ref = weakReference) {
        instance<DataSource>().createUser(context.session.id)
    } <1>
}
----


==== Weak Context Scope

Kodein provides the `WeakContextScope` scope.
This is a particular scope, as the context it holds on are weak references.

CAUTION: WeakContextScope is *NOT* compatible with `ScopeCloseable`.

You can use this scope when it makes sense to have a scope on a context that is held by the system for the duration of its life cycle.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: controller scoped to an Activity with WeakContextScope.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<Controller>() with scoped(WeakContextScope.of<Activity>()).singleton { ControllerImpl(context) } <1>
}
----
<1> `context` is of type `Activity` because we are using the `WeakContextScope.of<Activity>()`.

`WeakContextScope.of` will always return the same scope, which you should never clean!

If you need a compartimentalized scope which you can clean, you can create a new `WeakContextScope`:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creating a WeakContextScope.
----
val activityScope = WeakContextScope<Activity>()
----


[#context_translators]
==== Context translators

Let's get back to the web server example.
There is one session per user, so we have bound a `User` singleton inside a `Session` scope.
As each `Request` is associated with a `Session`, you can register a context translator that will make any binding that needs a `Session` context work with a `Request` context:

[source,kotlin]
.Example:
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<User>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { UserData(session.userId) }

    registerContextTranslator { r: Request -> r.session }
}
----

This allows you to retrieve a `User` instance:

- When there is a global `Request` context:
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: retriving with a global context
----
class MyController(override val kodein: Kodein, request: Request): KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinContext = kcontext(request)

    val user: User by instance()
}
----
- When the retrieval happens on a `Request` itself:
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: retriving with a global context
----
class MySpecialRequest(override val kodein: Kodein): Request(), KodeinAware {
    val user: User by instance()
}
----


==== Context finder

A context finder is a similar to context translator, except that it gets the context from a global context.

For example, if you are in a thread-based server where each request is assigned a thread (are people still doing those?!?), you could get the session from a global:

[source, kotlin]
.Example:
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<User>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { UserData(session.userId) }

    registerContextFinder { ThreadLocalSession.get() }
}
----

This allows to access a `User` object wihout specifying a context.

TIP: Having an other type of context declared will not block from using a context finder.


[[scope-creation]]
=== Scope creation

Scoped singletons/multitons are bound to a context and live while that context exists.

To define a scope that can contain scoped singletons or multitons, you must define an object that implements the `Scope` interface.
This object will be responsible for providing a `ScopeRegistry` according to a context.
It should always return the same `ScopeRegistry` when given the same context object.
A standard way of doing so is to use the `userData` property of the context, if it has one, or else to use a `WeakHashMap<C, ScopeRegistry>`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a simple session scope
----
object SessionScope : Scope<Session> { <1>
    override fun getRegistry(context: Session): ScopeRegistry =
            context.userData as? ScopeRegistry
                ?: StandardScopeRegistry().also { context.userData = it } <2>
}
----
<1> The scope's context type is `Session`.
<2> Creates a `ScopeRegistry` and attach it to the `Session` if there is none.

IMPORTANT: Scope providers should also provide standard context translators. +
           In this example, we should provide, along with `sessionScope` a module providing the `Request` to `Session` context translator.

[[scope-registry]]
==== Scope registry

The `ScopeRegistry` is responsible for holding value instances.
It is also responsible for calling the `close` methods on object that are `ScopeCloseable` when they are removed from the registry.

IMPORTANT: To have your scope compatible with `ScopeCloseable` values, make sure to `clean` the registry when the scope expires.

There are two standard implementations of `ScopeRegistry`:


===== StandardScopeRegistry

This is the "classic" expected `ScopeRegistry` behaviour.


===== SingleItemScopeRegistry

This is a particular `ScopeRegistry` implementation : it will only hold one item and replace the held item if the binding asks for an instance of another binding.

This means that a Multiton scoped with a Scope that uses a `SingleItemScopeRegistry` will actually hold only one instance: the one corresponding to the last argument.

CAUTION: You should NOT use this registry unless you know exactly WHAT you are doing, and WHY you are doing it.


==== Sub-scopes

You can define a scope to be defined inside another scope.
This means that when the parent scope clears, so does all of its subscopes.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a simple session scope
----
val requestScope = object : SubScope<Request, Session>(sessionScope) {
    override fun getParentContext(context: Request) = context.session
}
----

In this simple example, when the session expires, then all of its associates request scoped values also expire.


== Multi-binding

Kodein allows multi bindings via a binding set.


[[set-bindings]]
=== In a Set

==== Binding in a Set

To have multiple bindings in a set, you need to:

* Declare that you are using a set binding for a particular bound type.
* Add bindings to the set.

[source,kotlin]
.Example creating a set of `Configuration` bindings.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind() from setBinding<Configuration>() <1>

    bind<Configuration>().inSet() with provider { FooConfiguration() } <2>
    bind<Configuration>().inSet() with singleton { BarConfiguration() } <2>
}
----
<1> Creating a set binding of `Configuration`.
<2> Binding multiple `Configuration` implementations.

[NOTE]
====
You can:

* Use different binding types (such as `provider` or `singleton`) in the same set.
* Add bindings to the same set in different modules, provided that the set has been declared first.
====

You can also bind multiple bindings with arguments (such as `factory` or `multiton`) in a set *as long as all bindings share the same argument type*.

[source,kotlin]
.Example creating a set of `Result` bindings.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind() from argSetBinding<Query, Result>()

    bind<Result>().inSet() with factory { q: Query -> Foo.query(q) }
    bind<Result>().inSet() with multiton { q: Query -> Bar.query(q) }
}
----


==== Retrieving from a Set

Note that the type being bound is `Set<T>`, not `T`. +
Therefore, you need to retrieve a `Set`:

[source,kotlin]
.Example retrieving set of `Configuration` with the generic version.
----
val configurations: Set<Configuration> by kodein.instance()
----

if you are using the `erased` version, you need to retrieve thusly:

[source,kotlin]
.Example retrieving set of `Configuration` with the erased version.
----
val configurations: Set<Configuration> by kodein.Instance(erasedSet())
----


=== In a map

Kodein does not directly support map multi-binding.
However, it is very easy to create a binding map by using a binding set.

First, create the following primitive:

[source,kotlin]
.Example of the type alias for a map multi-binding as `Map<String, Configuration>`.
----
typealias ConfigurationEntry = Pair<String, Configuration>
typealias ConfigurationEntries = Set<ConfigurationEntry>
----

Then, bind with keys:

[source,kotlin]
.Example binding as in a map multibinding.
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind() from setBinding<ConfigurationEntry>()

    bind<ConfigurationEntry>().inSet() with factory { "foo" to FooConfiguration() }
    bind<ConfigurationEntry>().inSet() with multiton { "bar" to BarConfiguration() }
}
----

Finally, retrieve the map:

[source,kotlin]
.Example retrieving a map multibinding.
----
val configurations by kodein.instance<ConfigurationEntries>().toMap()
----


[[debugging]]
== Debugging

=== Print bindings

You can easily print bindings with `println(kodein.container.tree.bindings.description)`.

Here's an example of what this prints:

.An example of kodein.container.tree.bindings.description:
----
        bind<Dice>() with factory { Int -> RandomDice }
        bind<DataSource>() with singleton { SQLiteDataSource }
        bind<Random>() with provider { SecureRandom }
        bind<String>(tag = "answer") with instance ( Int )
----

As you can see, it's really easy to understand which type with which tag is bound to which implementation inside which scope.

NOTE: Description prints type names in a "kotlin-esque" way.
      Because Kodein does not depend on `kotlin-reflect`, it uses java `Type` objects that do not contain nullability information.
      As such, the type display does not include nullability. Still, it's easier to read `List<*>` than `List<? extends Object>`.


=== Recursive dependency loop

When it detects a recursive dependency, Kodein will throw a `Kodein.DependencyLoopException`.
The message of the exception explains how the loop happened.

.An example of recursive dependency loop:
----
Kodein$DependencyLoopException: Dependency recursion:
     bind<Database>()
    ╔╩>bind<User>() // <1>
    ║  ╚>bind<Repository>(tag = "users") // <2>
    ║    ╚>bind<Database>() // <3>
    ╚══════╝
----
<1> `Database` depends on `User`
<2> `User` depends on `Repository` with the tag "users"
<3> `Repository` with the tag "users" depends on `Database`, *we have found the dependency loop!*.


== OnReady callbacks

You can define callbacks to be called once the kodein instance is ready and all bindings are defined.
This can be useful to do some "starting" jobs.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: registering a callback at binding time
----
val appModule = Kodein.Module(name = "app") {
    import(engineModule)
    onReady {
        val engine = instance<Engine>()
        instance<Logger>().info("Starting engine version ${engine.version}")
        engine.start()
    }
}
----


== External Source

An external source is responsible for providing an answer when Kodein cannot find one.

When Kodein cannot find a binding for the required type/argument/context, then it calls the external source.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: an external source
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    externalSource = ExternalSource { key ->
        when (key.type.jvmType) { <1>
            Whatever::class.java -> when (key.argType.jvmType) { <2>
                Unit::class.java -> when (key.tag) { <3>
                    "user" -> externalFactory { existingInstance } <4>
                    null -> externalFactory { Whatever("default-value") } <4>
                    else -> null <6>
                }
                String::class.java -> when (key.tag) { <3>
                    null -> externalFactory { Whatever(it as String) } <5>
                    else -> null <6>
                }
                else -> null <6>
            }
            else -> null <6>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The type that is required
<2> The argument type (Unit if no argument)
<3> The tag (null if no tag)
<4> You can return an existing instance or a new one
<5> The argument has been checked to be a String, so it can be safely casted
<6> Return null if the external source has no answer

The `externalSource` property takes an `ExternalSource` instance, which is a SAM interface that can be implemented by a lambda with the `ExternalSource { }` constructor.
This `ExternalSource` is called every time a new `Key` is asked but not found.
The `Key` itself contains information about the binding that was asked but not found.

WARNING: The `ExternalSource` will be called only once per unknown key.

The `ExternalSource` must return a function (which you can easily create with the `externalFactory` utility function) that takes an `Any?` argument and returns the instance.
This function will be called *every time* an instance is requested.
Note that if no argument is provided, the argument to the lambda will be `Unit`.


[[erased-version]]
== Erased version pitfalls

=== The type erasure problem

When using the `generic` version on the JVM, Kodein is immune to type erasure, meaning that `bind<List<String>>()` and `bind<List<Int>>()` will represent two different bindings. +
Similarly, `kodein.instance<List<String>>()` and `kodein.instance<List<Int>>()` will yield two different list.

To be erasure immune, the `generic` JVM version relies heavily on the `generic` function, which is known to be slow.

To improve performance, you can use the `erased` JVM Kodein version, which is faster, but do suffer from type erasure!

Furthermore, on Javascript and Native platforms, there's no choice: `erased` is the only version available!


=== Using generic and erased function forms

Each kodein function that handles a type exists in two form: as inline (lowercased first letter) and as regular function (uppercased first letter). +
For example, the `kodein.instance` function also exists as `kodein.Instance`.

The uppercase functions need `TypeToken` parameters that define the type being bound / retrieved and maybe the factory's argument. +
You can easily use these functions with the `generic` or `erased` functions:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using the `erased` function
----
val ds: DataSource by kodein.Instance(erased())
----

By default, all inline functions are aliases to their uppercase counterparts using the `generic` function. +
For example, the `kodein.instance()` function is an alias to `kodein.Instance(generic())`

So, when you know that you inject a type that is *not generic*, you can use `kodein.Instance(erased())`.


=== Erased parameterized generic types

When using the `erased` function or using erased by default (either by choice on the JVM or by necessity elsewhere), you cannot represent a generic type. +
For example, `erased<Set<String>>` will yield a `TypeToken` representing `Set<*>`.

Kodein provides a way to represent a generic type in an erased way:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: generic type tokens, using erased
----
erasedComp1<Set<String>, String>()                         // Represents a Set<String>
erasedComp2<Map<Int, String>, Int, String>()               // Represents a Map<Int, String>
erasedComp3<Triple<Int, String, Int>, Int, String, Int>()  // Represents a Triple<Int, String, Int>
----

NOTE: The type parameter themselves are erased, meaning that you cannot represent a multi-level generic type.
      You can, however, construct your own `CompositeTypeToken` to represent such a type.


== Bind the same type to different factories

Yeah, when I said earlier that "you can have multiple bindings of the same type, as long as they are bound with different tags", I lied.
Because each binding is actually a _factory_, the binding tuples are not `([BindType], [Tag])` but actually `([ContextType], [BindType], [ArgType], [Tag])` (note that providers and singletons are bound as `([BindType], Unit, [Tag])`).
This means that any combination of these three information can be bound to it's own factory, which in turns means that you can bind the same type without tagging to different factories.

CAUTION: Please be cautious when using this knowledge, as other less thorough readers may get confused with it.


== Hack the container!

The KodeinContainer is the sacred Kodein object that contains all bindings and is responsible for retrieval.
You can access it with `kodein.container`.
In it, each `Binding` is bound to a `Kodein.Key`.

In fact, all Kodein functions are proxies to this container API.

When defining bindings, in the `Kodein.Builder`, you can access the `container` property to bind factories to a `Kodein.Key` or a `Kodein.Bind`.


=== Tag vs context vs argument

[options="header"]
|=======
| &nbsp;     | Binding identification | accessible by the binding _itself_* | accessible by the binding function
| *tag*      | instance               | no                                 | no
| *context*  | type                   | yes                                | yes
| *argument* | type                   | no                                 | yes
|=======


=== Explore bindings

You can access a *copy* of the bindings map with `kodein.container.bindings`. +
From this `Map<Kodein.Key, Factory<*, *>>`, you can explore all bindings, their keys and factories.
