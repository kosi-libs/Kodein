:branch: 7.1

This guide will help you migrate from Kodein 4 to Kodein 5+.

- The first part explains the changes and their reasoning.
- The second part gives steps to follow to port your code to Kodein 5+.

== Changes

=== New repository: JCenter

Kodein has moved from MavenCentral to JCenter.

The main reason for this move is that I need download statistics for professional reasons. +
Also, JCenter is a CDN. +
Also, JCenter allows me to manage a dedicated repo for beta releases.

IMPORTANT: Kodein is an open-source product and will always remain so.
           There will never be a "pro" paid version!
           The statistics are just to give me an "argument" in my future projects ;)

To you, it means that:

- You need to add the JCenter repository to your build system (Gradle or Maven).
- If you are using a beta version of Kodein, you need to add the Kodein specific repository.
- That's all ;)


=== New modules

Also, the module name have changed to reflect:

- The platform
- The generic / erased choice


=== New package: org.kodein.di

First and foremost, Kodein now has its dedicated domain name: http://kodein.org[kodein.org].

Kodein is now located inside the package `org.kodein.di`.


=== laziness

The biggest change in Kodein 5 is that everything in Kodein 5 is lazy. +
This is because:

- You shouldn't know whether the instance you are asking for will be easy to reatrieve or hard to construct.
- Some classes (such as Android or TornadoFX components) are created before being "attached" to their context.

Furthermore, the use of Kotlin's delegated properties allows:

- Factories to access context & receiver (very useful for TornadoFX & Android integration).
- The use of a trigger (previously known as injector) a lot easier.

IMPORTANT: The use of delegated properties does *not* significantly impact performance!

However, if you don't want all those benefits and still want direct access, Kodein 5 provides `DKodein` and `DKodeinAware` (D is for Direct), which works exactly like Kodein 4's `Kodein` and `KodeinAware`.


=== Currying

In Kodein 4, you would curry a factory into an instance by using `kodein.with(argument).instance()`, which is not really readable / understandable.

In Kodein 5, you curry via the `arg` parameter: `kodein.instance(arg = argument)`.


=== Injector

Kodein 5 radically changes the way the "injector" works.

In version 4, you would create a `KodeinInjector` and use it to retrieve dependencies.

In version 5, Kodein offers the `KodeinTrigger` and the `LateinitKodein` that each take a role of the previous `KodeinInjector`.

- `KodeinTrigger` allows you to define when you want your dependencies to be retrieved (rather than at first access)
- `LateInitKodein` allows you to use a Kodein-like shallow object and to define the location of a real Kodein object later.

TIP: In most cases, you won't need either of these classes, even if you were using a `KodeinInjector`.
     Because Kodein 5 is lazy by default, it eliminates most of the injector needs.


=== Scope & contexts

In Kodein 4, scopes used the factory argument as scope context.

In Kodein 5, there are a few new variable that Kodein uses to find binding & call factories.
Scopes now use a `context` value, which means that there can now be some scoped multiton (the scope uses the context while the multiton uses the argument).

TIP: Kodein 5 also allows the binding factories to access the receiver of the property.
     This is very useful for framework integration such as Android & TornadoFX.

The `Singleton` binding is now supercharged.
It handles scopes AND references, which means that it is now possible for weird stuff such as "weaked scoped singleton".

TIP: The `multiton` binding is the same!

Finally, there are no more such things as "auto-scopes".
They are replaced by scopes that do not need a particular provided context, e.g. `Scope<Any?, *>`.


=== Android

The Android specific scopes and types have been entirely rewritten to be lighter and less intrusive.


== Migration

=== New repository: JCenter

You need to add the jcenter repository to your project (if it is not already).

==== With Maven

[source,xml,subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;jcenter&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;https://jcenter.bintray.com&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
----

==== With Gradle

Add the JCenter repository:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
----

=== New modules

Module names have changed:

[options="header",width="60%"]
|=======
| Old name          | New name
| `kodein`          | `kodein-di-generic-jvm`
| `kodein-erased`   | `kodein-di-erased-jvm`
| `kodein-conf`     | `kodein-di-conf-jvm`
| `kodein-jxinject` | `kodein-di-jxinject-jvm`
| `kodein-android`  | `kodein-di-framework-android`
| `kodein-js`       | `kodein-di-erased-js`
| `kodein-conf-js`  | `kodein-di-conf-js`
|=======


=== New package: org.kodein.di

Well, the new package is now `org.kodein.di`. So, you know, update the imports ;)

[options="header",width="70%"]
|=======
| Old name                                 | New name
| `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein` *        | `org.kodein.di`
| `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein` *        | `org.kodein.di.generic`
| `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein.erased`   | `org.kodein.di.erased`
| `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein.conf`     | `org.kodein.di.conf`
| `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein.jxinject` | `org.kodein.di.jxinject`
| `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein.android`  | `org.kodein.di.android`
|=======

_The `com.github.salomonbrys.kodein` package has been split up between core and generic code.
This allows Kodein to be used with Java 9._


=== Laziness

This is by far the most important change in your migration.


==== For JVM / Server

You now have a choice : either you embrace this new laziness philosophy, or you fight it ;)
In fact, both choice are pretty easy to make!

NOTE: Injection, a.k.a. `kodein.newInstance { }`, is not impacted.
      Only retrieval is.


===== Lazy by default

If you want to use laziness by default, as Kodein now does, simply replace all `=` with `by`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: updating retrieval code to use Kodein's laziness
----
// Kodein 4
val ds: DataSource = kodein.instance()

// Kodein 5
val ds: DataSource by kodein.instance()
----

However, if you don't want to use laziness, you need to update your code to


===== Direct by default

If you want to keep Kodein 4's direct retrieval by default, you simply need to:

- handle `DKodein` objects instead of `Kodein`
- have your classes being `DKodeinAware` instead of `KodeinAware`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: creating a `DKodein`
----
val kodein = Kodein.direct { <1>
    /* bindings */
}
----
<1> This `.direct` will return a `DKodein`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a `DKodeinAware` class
----
class MyController(override val dkodein: DKodein) : DKodeinAware
----


==== For Android

In Android, the laziness by default is actually a very good thing, as you don't need things like `KodeinInjector` or `LazyKodein`:

Also, `appKodein()` is replaced by `closestKodein()`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a `KodeinAware` Activity
----
class MyActivity() : Activity(), KodeinAware {
    override val kodein by closestKodein()
    private val usersManagers: UsersManagers by instance()
}
----

NOTE: If you were using Android specific types (such as `KodeinActivity`), you should read the <<android,Android>> section.


=== Currying

There's a new currying syntax:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: new currying syntax
----
// Kodein 4
val dice: Dice = kodein.with(6).instance()

// Kodein 5
val ds: DataSource by kodein.instance(arg = 6)
----

TIP: Much like the `tag` argument, the `arg` argument should always be named.


=== Injector

If you were using a `KodeinInjector`, you now need to use a `KodeinTrigger` and/or a `LateInitKodein`.


==== Trigger

The `KodeinTrigger` class allows you to define when the dependencies will be retrieved (as opposed to lazily when needed).


===== By itself

You can use the `on` function to create a `Kodein` object that is bound to a `KodeinTrigger`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a Kodein bound to a KodeinTrigger
----
val tk = kodein.on(trigger = KodeinTrigger())
val ds: DataSource by tk.instance()
tk.kodeinTrigger!!.trigger()
----


===== In KodeinAware

It is really easy to use a `KodeinTrigger` in a KodeinAware class:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a KodeinAware class with a trigger
----
class MyManager(override val kodein: Kodein) : KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinTrigger = KodeinTrigger() <1>
    val ds: DataSource by tk.instance()
    init {
        kodeinTrigger.trigger() <2>
    }
}
----
<1> The `kodeinTrigger` property of a KodeinAware class


==== Late init

===== In KodeinAware

In a `KodeinAware` class, you can set the `kodein` value to be `late init`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a KodeinAware class with a late init kodein
----
class MyManager : KodeinAware {
    override late init var kodein: Kodein <1>
    val ds: DataSource by instance()
    init {
        kodein = applicationGlobals.kodein <2>
    }
}
----
<1> The `kodein` property is `late init`, which is not a problem as long as you set it before _accessing_ a dependency.
<2> You can access dependencies after setting the `kodein` variable.


===== By itself

For classes that are _not_ `KodeinAware`, Kodein offers the `LateInitKodein` class, which acts very similarly:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: use of LateInitKodein
----
val lk = LateInitKodein()
val ds: DataSource by lk.instance()
lk.baseKodein = applicationGlobals.kodein
----


=== Scope contexts

Scopes now use the `context` variable, instead of the factory argument `arg`.


==== Binding with a scope

The syntax to bind a scoped singleton has evolved:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding with a scope
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    // Kodein 4
    bind<Session>() with scopedSingleton(requestScope) { /* ... */ }

    // Kodein 5
    bind<Session>() with scoped(requestScope).singleton { /* ... */ }
}
----


==== Getting a scoped singleton instance

===== Retrieval context

A scope is now defined function of a `context`, rather than of an `arg`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: getting an instance of a scoped singleton
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    // Kodein 4
    val session by kodein.with(request).instance()

    // Kodein 5
    val session by kodein.on(context = request).instance()
}
----


===== KodeinAware context

You can define a context that works for an entire `KodeinAware` class.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a context for the entire KodeinAware class
----
class MyController(request: Request) : KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinContext = kcontext(request)
    val session by instance()
}
----

NOTE: Setting a `kodeinContext` still allows you to acces bindings without scopes!
      The `kodeinContext` is the context _by default_, but will not be used if there is no need for a context.


[[android]]
=== Android

The Kodein Android extension has radically changed.
It is therefore advised to read https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/android[the new Kodein on Android documentation].


==== Laziness

Because everything is lazy be default, it is now very easy to use `KodeinAware` with Android components (note that `closestKodein` replaces `appKodein`):

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a context for the entire KodeinAware class
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), KodeinAware {
    override val kodein by closestKodein() <1>
    val ds: DataSource by instance()
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        ds.connect() <2>
        /* ... */
    }
}
----
<1> The `closestKodein` function replaces the `appKodein` v4 function.
<2> Because everything is lazy, the kodein AND ds instances will both be retrieved only when needed, which is at that time.


==== Layered dependencies

The `KodeinActivity` class, `KodeinInjector` interface, and all their component equivalent are gone.
what they did was:

- Provide an injector, which is no longer needed since Kodein 5 is lazy by default.
- Allowed to create a "sub-kodein" with some new or overriding bindings, which this guide explains how to do.
- Provide a Kodein object that reflects those new or overriding bindings, which is what `closestKodein` does.

To create a component that creates it's own Kodein object, simply override the `kodein` value, create a new Kodein object, and extend the parent kodein in it:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a context for the entire KodeinAware class
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), KodeinAware {
    private val _parentKodein by closestKodein()  <1>
    override val kodein: Kodein by Kodein {
        extend(_parentKodein)  <2>
        /* activity specific bindings */
    }
}
----
<1> Get the "global" application kodein.
<2> Extends the "global" application kodein, to be able to access, with this new Kodein object, all bindings defined at the application level.


==== Scopes

All android scopes are replaced by the `androidScope` function:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding with an activity scope
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    // Kodein 4
    bind<Whatever>() with scopedSingleton(activityScope) { /* ... */ }

    // Kodein 5
    bind<Whatever>() with scoped(androidScope<Activity>()).singleton { /* ... */ }
}
----


==== Modules

The `androidModule` still exists but now need the application context:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: importing the android module
----
class MyApplication : Application(), KodeinAware {
    override val kodein = Kodein.lazy {
        import(androidModule(this@MyApplication))
	    /* bindings */
    }
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `autoAndroidModule` is gone and will not return!
Its implementation was far too messy and leak-prone.
To find the "closest" context, Kodein uses either the receiver or the context, which you must provide if the `KodeinAware` class is not an Android component:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: defining the android context as the kodein context
----
class MyController(override val kodein: Kodein, val context: Context) : KodeinAware {
    override val kodeinContext = kcontext(context)
    private val vibrator: Vibrator by instance()
}
----
