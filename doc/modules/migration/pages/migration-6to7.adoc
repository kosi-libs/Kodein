= Changes & Migration from _Kodein-DI 6_ to _Kodein-DI 7_


This guide will help you migrate from Kodein-DI 6 to Kodein-DI 7+.

- The first part explains the changes and their reasoning.
- The second part gives steps to follow to port your code to Kodein-DI 7+.

== Changes

=== New type system

As Kotlin evolves, we are trying to keep the pace. So, we have introduced a new type system to empower *Kodein-DI* and other libraries, using new features of Kotlin.
You can find it on https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-Type[Github].

It gives us the ability to handle generic types for all the platforms, including Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JS, by using the inline function https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/type-of.html[`typeOf()'].
for the JVM, the mechanism remains the same as before, by using reflection.

We still have both implementations with `generic` and `erased` types, but by default, *Kodein-DI* is using the `generic` version.
This means that *Native* and *JS* targets are now compatible with generics, meaning that `bind<List<String>>()` and `bind<List<Int>>()` will represent two different bindings.

TIP: Checkout the xref:ROOT:index.adoc[full documentation] for more details.

=== New modules

This new type system ha permitted us to simplify the core libraries.
Before `7.0` you had to use `kodein-di-core` and either `kodein-di-erased` (for all platforms) or `kodein-di-generic-jvm` (for the JVM / Android).

Now you just need to import on single module, to get the core features of *Kodein-DI*:

[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di:{version}")
----

=== Deprecated package: `erased` / `generic`

Another side effect of the new type system, there is not so much differences made between `erased`/ `generic` implementations, as `generic` is now the default usage in *Kodein-DI*.
So, the whole packages `org.kodein.di.erased` and `org.kodein.di.generic` have been deprecated.
Implementation are now in the root package ``org.kodein.di`, and as told before, are based on the generic counterpart of the type system.

TIP: Differences are subtle, please read the xref:ROOT:index.adoc[full documentation] for more details.

=== Class renaming: *Kodein* -> *DI*

New libraries have been released under the *Kodein Framework*, like *Kodein-DB*.
Thus, we thought that is was legit to change the `Kodein` part of our class names, in the benefit of an more explicit one `DI`.

Basically, every classes that were named after `Kodein` have been renamed with `DI`, like `KodeinAware` -> `DIAware`.

== Migration

This section is aimed to guide you through the migration to +Kodein-DI 7.0*.

=== New modules

Module names have changed, but also there number. If you want to use core features of *Kodein-DI*, you no longer have to import multiple modules.
Just grab the new `kodein-di` module! If you are using frameworks, you should find more details down below.

[options="header",width="50%"]
|=======
| Old name                  | New name
| `kodein-di-core`          | `kodein-di`
| `kodein-di-generic-jvm`   | `kodein-di`
| `kodein-di-erased`        | `kodein-di`
|=======

If you have enable the use of Gradle Metadata with `enableFeaturePreview("GRADLE_METADATA")`, or even *Gradle 6+*. Just use this import:

[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di:{version}")
----

Otherwise, use the specific import, depending on your target:

[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-jvm:{version}")
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-js:{version}")
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-linuxx64:{version}")
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-macosx64:{version}")
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-mingwx64:{version}")
// ...
----

=== Deprecated package: `erased` / `generic`

Packages `org.kodein.di.erased` and `org.kodein.di.generic` are fully deprecated.
Everything that was inside those packages have been move into `org.kodein.di`

You should get a replace action from IDEA for most of those implementation.
But, if for some reasons IDEA does not provide you this action, you should just remove those packages from your imports.

[options="header",width="50%"]
|=======
| Old package name        | Replace with
| `org.kodein.di.generic` | `org.kodein.di`
| `org.kodein.di.erased`  | `org.kodein.di`
|=======

=== Class renaming: *Kodein* -> *DI*

Here comes the tricky part of the migration. Our internals are using companions objects and nested classes,
thus we could not just duplicate them and deprecated the old ones. We had to use some tricks, like typealiases.
Doing so we may have broke some (old) APIs, and the migration from *6.0* to *7.0* made those changes not optional.

Sometimes IDEA will provide you with some nice actions like replacing all the occurrences automatically,
but sometimes you may have to do this manually. Here is a bunch of use cases that you may encounter:

==== Kodein interface

When migrating to *Kodein-DI 7+*, you will quickly notice some compile / deprecation errors.

The first one might be on the more import type in _Kodein-DI_, `Kodein`.

Sometimes, _IntelliJ IDEA_ will encourage you to refactor your code with some actions, with _Alt+Enter_ / _Cmd+Enter_.

[cols="65%,<.^35%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image::6to7/kodein-to-di.png[Kodein to DI, 800]
|Either from your code
|image::6to7/kodein-to-di-2.png[Kodein to DI, 800]
|Or in the import section
|image::6to7/kodein-builder.png[Kodein-DI builder, 500]
|Sometimes it won't resolve the deprecation annotations, but will still have some actions to replace the deprecated interface...
|===

==== KodeinAware interface

The second most important type in _Kodein-DI_ is `KodeinAware`, that we will need to refactor to ... `DIAware`.

If you were using `KodeinAware` in your projects, you might end up with something like this:

[cols="65%,<.^35%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image::6to7/diaware-1.png[DIAware, 800]
|Both interface implementation and the class implementing it are with errors.
|===

First thing, replace `KodeinAware` with `DIAware` (_Alt+Enter_ / _Cmd+Enter_ is your best friend here):

image::6to7/diaware-2.png[DIAware, 800]

After that, you will need to make changes to the class that is implementing `DIAware`. +
Because we also had renamed the properties from `KodeinAware`, you might have some errors on the following properties.

[options="header",width="50%"]
|=======
| Old name                     | New name
| `kodein`                     | `di`
| `kodeinContext`              | `diContext`
| `kodeinTrigger`              | `diTrigger`
|=======

image::6to7/diaware-3.png[DIAware, 800]

Unfortunately, _IntelliJ IDEA_ won't help you for migrating those properties, you will have to do it manually. +

[cols="65%,<.^35%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image::6to7/diaware-4.png[DIAware, 800]
|Replace `override kodein: Kodein` by `override di: DI`, either in the constructor or in the member implementation.
|image::6to7/diaware-5.png[DIAware, 800]
|Here we are, nice and fresh!
|===

The same manipulation goes for `kodeinContext` and `kodeinTrigger`

image::6to7/kcontext.png[kcontext, 800]

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the cases of `kodeinContext`, the property AND the expression might worth changing
image::6to7/dicontext.png[dicontext]
====

==== Binding & retrieval

Binding and retrieval are really easier as they just have been deprecated and moved to `org.kodein.di`.


[cols="65%,<.^35%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image::6to7/binder-1.png[Builder]
|No error here ;)
|image::6to7/binder-2.png[Builder]
|Deprecation message suggest to use the functions defined in `org.kodein.di`.
|image::6to7/binder-3.png[Builder]
|Once again _IntelliJ IDEA_ won't help you there, just drop the imports `org.kodein.di.erased` / `org.kodein.di.generic`
|===

IMPORTANT: Removing the package imports `org.kodein.di.erased` / `org.kodein.di.generic` should help you in lot of cases.

Otherwise, just re-import the right package!

==== All the matches

As said before, all the classes / objects named after *Kodein* have been renamed with *DI*.
Here is the table of all the correspondences, for the public classes:

[options="header",width="50%"]
|=======
| Old name                     | New name

|=======

== What about your favorite framework?

Each one of the framework modules relies heavily on the core library of _Kodein-DI_, `kodein-di`.
So, there is not so much migration here, mostly extensions functions to access easily to the DI container.

You will find the table of correspondence for each framework right below.

=== Android

Importing the *Android* modules of *Kodein-DI* are now easier. You don't need to chose between `erased` and `generic` anymore.
A simple gradle dependency will do :)

[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-framework-android-core:{version}")
// OR
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-framework-android-support:{version}")
// OR
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-framework-android-x:{version}")
----

Here is the table of all the correspondences, for the public classes / functions, by module:
