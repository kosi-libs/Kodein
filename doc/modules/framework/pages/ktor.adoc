:version: 7.1.0
:branch: 7.1

You can use Kodein-DI as-is in your Ktor project, but you can level-up your game by using the libraries `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-jvm` or `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-controller-jvm`.

NOTE: Kodein-DI does work on Ktor as-is.
      The `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-jvm` / `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-controller-jvm` extensions add multiple ktor-specific utilities to Kodein. +
      Using or not using this extension really depends on your needs.

NOTE: Ktor is a multi-platform project, meaning you can use it for JVM, JS and Native projects.
      Please note that, at the moment, Kodein-DI utilities are only available for the JVM platform, for the server cases precisely.

Have a look at the https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI/tree/{branch}/demo/demo-ktor[Ktor demo project] to help you to go further!

[[difeature]]
== `DIFeature`

As a Ktor https://ktor.io/servers/application.html[Application] is based on extensions we cannot use the `DIAware` mechanism on it.
So, we had to find another, elegant, way to provide a global DI container. That's where the `DIFeature` stands.
It allows developers to create an instance of a DI container, that will be available from anywhere in their Ktor app.

To help with that, the `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-jvm` provides a https://ktor.io/advanced/features.html[custom feature]
that will create and register an instance of a DI container in the application's https://ktor.io/advanced/pipeline/attributes.html[attributes].
Thus, the DI will be reachable from multiple places in your Ktor application.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a Ktor Application declaration, installing the `DIFeature`
----
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        di { // <1>
            bind<Random>() with singleton { SecureRandom() } // <2>
        }
   }.start(true)
}
----
<1> Install the `DIFeature` (under the hood we are applying `install(DIFeature, configuration)`)
<2> Lambda that represent a DI builder, accepting DI core features

WARNING: If you install multiple `DIFeature` on the same Ktor `Application`, only one will be taken into account, obviously the last one that has been declared.

=== Closest DI pattern

The idea behind this concept, is to be able to retrieve a DI container, from an outer class. The `DIFeature`
help us with that by defining a DI container that can be retrieve from multiple places, like:

- Application
- ApplicationCall
- Routing / Routes

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a Ktor Application declaration, installing the `DIFeature`, and retrieving it from routes
----
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        di { // <1>
            bind<Random>() with singleton { SecureRandom() } // <2>
        }

        routing {
            get("/") {
                val random by di().instance<Random>() // <3>
                /* logic here */
            }
        }
   }.start(true)
}
----
<1> Install the `DIFeature`
<2> Lambda that represent a DI builder, accepting DI core features
<3> retrieving the DI container from the Application by calling `PipelineContext<*, ApplicationCall>.di` extension function

.Available `di()` extension function receivers
- https://ktor.io/servers/application.html#application[Application]

    fun Application.main() {
        /* usage */
        val di = di()

        /* other usage */
        val random by di().instance<Random>()
    }

- https://ktor.io/advanced/pipeline.html#interceptors-and-the-pipelinecontext[PipelineContext<*, ApplicationCall>]

    get {
        /* usage */
        val di = di()

        /* other usage */
        val random by di().instance<Random>()
    }

- https://ktor.io/servers/calls.html[ApplicationCall]

    get("/") {
        /* usage */
        val di = call.di()

        /* other usage */
        val random by call.di().instance<Random>()
    }

- https://ktor.io/servers/features/routing.html[Routing]

    routing {
        /* usage */
        val di = di()

        /* other usage */
        val random by di().instance<Random>()
    }

NOTE: Because of those extension functions you can always get the DI object by using:
    - `di()` inside a Ktor class (such as `Application`, `ApplicationCall`, `Route`, etc.)
    - `di { application }` inside another class, where application is the running Ktor application.

WARNING: The `di()` extension function will only work if your Ktor `Application` has the `DIFeature` installed, or if you handle the installation manually.

=== Extending the nearest DI container

In some cases we might want to extend our global DI container for local needs. For example, we could extend the DI container for a login `Route`, by adding credentials bindings, thus they would be only available in the login `Route` and its children.

We can easily achieve this goal, as we have facilities to retrieve our DI container with the previously defined extension functions,
To do so we have a function `subDI` available for the `Routing` / `Route` classes.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a Ktor Application declaration, installing the `DIFeature`, and retrieving it from routes
----
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        di { // <1>
            bind<Random>() with singleton { SecureRandom() } // <2>
        }

        routing {
            route("/login") {
                subDI {
                    bind<CredentialsDao> with singleton { CredentialsDao() } // <3>
                }

                post {
                    val dao by di().instance<CredentialsDao>() // <4>
                    /* logic here */
                }
            }
        }
   }.start(true)
}
----
<1> Install the `DIFeature`
<2> Lambda that represent a DI builder, accepting DI core features
<3> Adding new binding that will be only available for the children of the `/login` route
<4> Retrieve the `CredentialsDao` from the nearest DI container

WARNING: If you define multiple `routing { }` features, Ktor have a specific way of joining the different routing definition, finally there is only one `Routing` object. Thus, if you define multiple `subDI { }` in your different `routing { }` declaration, only one `subDI` will be taking into account.

WARNING: The `subDI` mechanism will only work if your Ktor `Application` has the `DIFeature` installed, or if you handle the installation manually.

NOTE: On the contrary you can define a `subDI { }` object for each of your `Route`s as each of them will be able to embbed a DI instance.

.*Copying bindings*

With this feature we can extend our DI container. This extension is made by copying the none singleton / multiton,
but we have the possibility to copy all the binding (including singleton / multiton).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying all the bindings
----
DI {
    bind<Foo>() with provider { Foo("rootFoo") }
    bind<Bar>() with singleton { Bar(instance()) }
}

subDI(copy = Copy.All) { // <1>
    /** new bindings / overrides **/
}
----
<1> Copying all the bindings, with the singletons / multitons

WARNING: By doing a `Copy.All` your original singleton / multiton won't be available anymore, in the new DI container, they will exist as new instances.

.*Overriding bindings*

Sometimes, It might be interesting to replace an existing dependency (by overriding it).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: overriding bindings
----
DI {
    bind<Foo>() with provider { Foo("rootFoo") }
    bind<Bar>() with singleton { Bar(instance()) }
}

subDI {
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo("explicitFoo") } // <1>
}
subDI(allowSilentOverrides = true) { // <2>
    bind<Foo> with provider { Foo("implicitFoo") }
}
----
<1> Overriding the `Foo` binding
<2> Overriding in the `subDI` will be implicit

This feature is restricted to the `Routing` / `Route` and can be used like:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: extend from multiple places
----
// https://ktor.io/servers/features/routing.html[Routing]
    routing {
        /* usage */
        val subDI = subDI { /** new bindings / overrides **/ } // <1>

        route("/books") {
            /* usage */
            subDI { /** new bindings / overrides **/ } // <2>

            route("/author") {
                /* usage */
                subDI { /** new bindings / overrides **/ } // <3>
            }
        }
    }
----
<1> extending the nearest DI instance, most likely the Application's one
<2> extending the nearest DI instance, the one created in <1>
<3> extending the nearest DI instance, the one created in <2>

== Ktor scopes

=== Session scopes

With the `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-jvm` utils you can scope your dependencies upon your Ktor sessions. To do that you'll have to follow the steps:

. Defining your session by implementing `DISession`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining the session
----
data class UserSession(val user: User) : DISession { // <1>
    override fun getSessionId() = user.id // <2>
}
----
<1> Create session object that implements `KtorSession`
<2> Implement the function `getSessionId()`

. Defining your scoped dependencies
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining the session scoped dependencies
----
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8000) {
        install(Sessions) { // <1>
            cookie<UserSession>("SESSION_FEATURE_SESSION_ID") // <2>
        }
        di {
            bind<Random>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { SecureRandom() } // <3>
            /* binding */
        }
    }.start(true)
}
----
<1> Install the `Sessions` feature
<2> Declaring a session cookie represented by `UserSession`
<3> Bind `Random` object scoped by `SessionScope`

. Retrieving your scoped dependencies
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving session scoped dependencies
----
embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8000) {
    /* configurations */
    routing {
        get("/random") {
            val session = call.sessions.get<UserSession>() ?: error("no session found!") // <1>
            val random by di().on(session).instance<Random>() // <2>
            call.responText("Hello ${session.user.name}, your random number is ${random.nextInt()}")
        }
    }
}.start(true)
----
<1> Retrieve the `session` from the request context or fail
<2> retrieve a `Random` object from the `DI` object scoped by `session`

. Clear the scope as long as the sessions are no longer used
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Clear the session and scope
----
get("/clear") {
    call.sessions.clearSessionScope<UserSession>() // <1>
}
----
+
<1> clear the session and remove the `ScopeRegistry` linked to the session
+
IMPORTANT:  A Ktor session is cleared by calling the function `CurrentSession.clear<Session>()`.
            To clear the session combine to the scope removal you *MUST* use the extension function `CurrentSession.clearSessionScope<Session>()`,
            thus the session will be cleared and the `ScopeRegistry` removed.

[CAUTION]
====
.When working with multiple server instances you should be careful of what you are doing.
You should be aware that using the same session over multiple servers won't give you the same instance of your scoped dependencies.
In that context you might consider using a mechanism that always redirect a session request on the same server.
This mechanism will not be provided by Ktor or Kodein-DI.
====

=== Call scope

Kodein-DI provides a standard scope for any object (Ktor or not).
The `WeakContextScope` will keep singleton and multiton instances as long as the context (= object) lives.

That's why the `CallScope` is just a wrapper upon `WeakContextScope` with the target `ApplicationCall`, that lives only along the Request (HTTP or Websocket).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining call scoped dependencies
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Random>() with scoped(CallScope).singleton { SecureRandom() } // <1>
}
----
<1> A `Random` object will be created for each Request (HTTP or Websocket) and will be retrieved as long as the Request lives.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving call scoped dependencies
----
 get {
    val random by di().on(context).instance<Random>()
}
----

== DI Controllers

To help those who want to implement a Ktor application base on a "MVC-like" architecture, we provide a https://ktor.io/advanced/features.html[custom feature]. This feature is a specific module called `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-controller-jvm`. To enable it, add this line in your `dependencies` block in your application `build.gradle(.kts)` file:

[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Groovy script
----
implementation 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-controller-jvm:{version}'
----

[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-controller-jvm:{version}")
----

NOTE:  the `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-controller-jvm` already have  the `kodein-di-framework-ktor-server-jvm` as transitive dependency, so you don't need to declare both.

===  Defining your controllers, by implementing `DIController`, or extending `AbstractDIController`
+
To define your controllers you need, either to implement the interface `DIController`, or to extend the class `AbstractDIController` and implement the function `Route.getRoutes()`.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Implementing DIController
----
class MyController(application: Application) : DIController { // <1>
    override val di by di { application } // <2>
    private val repository: DataRepository by instance("dao") // <3>

    override fun Route.getRoutes() { // <4>
        get("/version") { // <5>
            val version: String by instance("version") // <6>
            call.respondText(version)
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Implement `DIController` and provide a `Application` instance (from constructor)
<2> Override the `DI` container, from the provided `Application`
<3> Use your `DI` container as in any `DIAware` class
<4> Override the function `Route.getRoutes` and define some routes
<5> This route will be automatically register by the `DIControllerFeature`
<6> Use your `DI` container as in any `DIAware` class

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Extending AbstractDIController
----
class MyController(application: Application) : AbstractDIController(application) { // <1>
    private val repository: DataRepository by instance("dao") // <2>

    override fun Routing.installRoutes() { // <3>
        get("/version") { // <4>
            val version: String by instance("version") // <5>
            call.respondText(version)
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Extend `AbstractDIController` and provide a `Application` instance (from constructor)
<2> Use your `DI` container as in any `DIAware` class
<3> Override the function `Routing.installRoutes` and define some routes
<4> This route will be automatically register by the `DIControllerFeature`
<5> Use your `DI` container as in any `DIAware` class

NOTE:   Using `DIController` or `AbstractDIController` depends on your needs.
        +
        If you don't need to use inheritance on your controllers, then you could benefit from using `AbstractDIController`.
        +
        On the contrary, if you want to use inheritance for your controllers you should implement `DIController` and override the `DI` container by yourself.

WARNING: Using the `DIControllerFeature` *must* be used in addition of the `DIFeature`

WARNING: In your code, the `DIControllerFeature` *must* be declared *after* the `DIFeature`, as in the previous snippet *4* is declared after *1*, unless you'll see a `MissingApplicationFeatureException` fired

- Install your `DIController`s routes directly into the routing system
+
To leverage the use of `DIController`, you *could* use the `Route.controller` extension functions.
Those functions will automatically install the routes defined in your `DIController` into the Ktor routing system.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Route.controller extension functions
----
routing {
// ...
controller { MyFirstDIController(instance()) } // <1>
controller("/protected") { MySecondDIController(instance()) } // <2>
// ...
}
----
<1> install the routes of MyFirstDIController` inside the routing system
<2> install the routes of `MyFirstDIController` inside the routing system, as child of a `Route`, under "/protected"
+
Doing that the `MyFirstDIController` and `MyFirstDIController` will added to the routing system but not autowired, neither bound to the DI container.
Only their routes defined in the `Route.getRoutes` will be reachable on the web server (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/version`).


[CAUTION]
====
`Route.controller` extension functions and `DIControllerFeature` can be used at the same time but we recommand that you *should not*
Declaring controllers in the `Route.controller` extension functions and the `DIControllerFeature` might install the same route multiple times, thus leading to exceptions.
====
