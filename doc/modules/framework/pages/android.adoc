= Kodein-DI on Android
:version: 7.1.0
:branch: 7.1

You can use Kodein-DI as-is in your Android project or use the util library `kodein-di-android`.

NOTE: Kodein-DI does work on Android as-is.
      The `kodein-di-android` extension adds multiple android-specific utilities to Kodein-DI. +
      Using or not using this extension really depends on your needs.

Have a look at the https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-Samples/tree/master/di/coffee-maker/android[Android demo project]!

== Install

.How to use `kodein-di-android`:
. Add this line in your `dependencies` block in your application `build.gradle` file:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
implementation 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-framework-android-???:{version}'
----
+
Kodein-DI offers support for:
+
[cols="1,2"]
|=======
| *Barebone Android*           | `kodein-di-framework-android-core`
| *Android + Support library*  | `kodein-di-framework-android-support`
| *Android + AndroidX library* | `kodein-di-framework-android-x`
|=======
+
IMPORTANT: From `6.3.0` On the JVM, you must be targeting `JDK 1.8` minimum!
+
WARNING: If you are using `SupportFragment` in your application, then you *must* use either the `-support` or the `-x` package.

. Declare the dependency bindings in the Android `Application`, having it implements `DIAware`.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: an Android Application class that implements DIAware
----
class MyApp : Application(), DIAware {
	override val di by DI.lazy { <1>
	    /* bindings */
	}
}
----
<1> Using `DI.lazy` allows you to access the `Context` at binding time.
+
TIP: Don't forget to declare the Application in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file!

. In your Activities, Fragments, and other context aware android classes, retrieve the `DI` object with the `di` function.

. Retrieve your dependencies!


== Retrieving

Injection does not work on Android classes that are reified by the system (`Activity`, `Fragment`, etc.) due the fact that... they are reified by the system!
Therefore, on such classes, you can either use retrieval, or if you want these classes to be independent of Kodein-DI, use the <<dependency-holder,dependency holder pattern>>.


=== Getting a DI object

You can always get the `DI` object by using:

- `di()` inside an Android class (such as `Context`, `Activity`, `Fragment`, etc.)
- `di(context)` or `di { context }` inside another class

CAUTION: The `di` function will only work if your Android `Application` class implements the `DIAware` interface.

TIP: The `di` result should be cached and not used multiple times in a row.


=== Being DIAware

It is very simple to have your Android classes be `DIAware`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a DIAware Android Activity
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {

    override val di by di() <1>

    val ds: DataSource by instance()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        ds.connect() <2>
        /* ... */
    }

}
----
<1> Retrieving the application DI instance via context.
<2> Because everything is lazy, the `di` AND `ds` instances will both be retrieved only when needed, which is at that time.


=== Using a Trigger

If you want all dependencies to be retrieved at `onCreate`, you can very easily use a trigger:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using an trigger in a DIAware Android Activity
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {

    override val di by di()

    override val diTrigger = DITrigger() <1>

    val ds: DataSource by instance()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        diTrigger.trigger() <2>
        /* ... */
    }

}
----
<1> Just create a trigger, and Kodein-DI will automatically use it.
<2> The `di` AND all dependencies will both be retrieved at that time.

NOTE: Using this approach has an important advantage: as all dependencies are retrieved in `onCreate`, you can be sure that all your dependencies have correctly been retrieved, meaning that there were no non-declared dependency. +
      If you only use `instance` (no `provider` or `factory`), you can also be sure that there were no dependency loop.


=== View Models

To use Kodein-DI, you need an Android context.
For that, View Models need to implement `AndroidViewModel`.

It is very easy to use Kodein-DI inside View Models:

NOTE: If you prefer your View Models to be independant from Kodein-DI, you can use a <<view-model-factory,View  Model Factory>>.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using an trigger in a DIAware Android Activity
----
class MyViewModel(app: Application) : ApplicationViewModel(app), DIAware {

    override val di by di() <1>

    val repository : Repository by instance()
}
----
<1> Retrieving the application's DI container.


== Android module

Kodein-DI-Android proposes a `Module` that enables easy retrieval of a lot of standard android services.

NOTE: This module is absolutely *optional*, you are free to use it or leave it ;).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: importing the android module
----
class MyApplication : Application(), DIAware {
    override val di by DI.lazy {
        import(androidXModule(this@MyApplication)) <1>
	    /* bindings */
    }
}
----
<1> Can either be `androidXModule` or `androidSupportModule` or `androidCoreModule`.

You can see everything that this module proposes in the Kodein-Android https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI/blob/{branch}/framework/android/kodein-di-framework-android-core/src/main/java/org/kodein/di/android/module.kt[module.kt] file.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using kodein-DI to retrieve a LayoutInflater
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {
    override val di by di()
    val inflater: LayoutInflater by instance() <1>
}
----

If you are retrieving these classes inside a non-Android class, you need to define an Android `Context` as a DI context:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using DI with a context to retrieve a LayoutInflater
----
val inflater: LayoutInflater by di.on(getActivity()).instance()
----

or

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using DI with a class context to retrieve a LayoutInflater
----
class MyUtility(androidContext: Context) : DIAware {

    override val di by androidContext.di()

    override val kodeinContext = diContext(androidContext) <1>

    val inflater: LayoutInflater by instance()
}
----
<1> Defining the default context: the Android context to use to retrieve Android system services.


== Android context translators

The android module provides a number of http://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/core#_context_translators[context translators].
For example, they allow you to retrieve an activity scoped singleton inside a fragment, without manually specifying the activity.

NOTE: The android modules automatically register these translators.

However, if you don't want to use the android modules, but still need these translators, you can register them easily:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: importing the android module
----
class MyApplication : Application(), DIAware {
    override val di by DI.lazy {
        import(androidXContextTranslators) <1>
	    /* bindings */
    }
}
----
<1> Can either be `androidXContextTranslators` or `androidSupportContextTranslators` or `androidCoreContextTranslators`.


== Android scopes

=== Component scopes

Kodein-DI provides a standard scope for any component (Android or not).
The `WeakContextScope` will keep singleton and multiton instances as long as the context (= component) lives.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using an Activity scope
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Controller>() with scoped(WeakContextScope.of<Activity>()).singleton { ControllerImpl(context) } <1>
}
----
<1> `context` is of type `Activity` because we are using the `WeakContextScope.of<Activity>()`.

CAUTION: WeakContextScope is *NOT* compatible with `ScopeCloseable`.


=== Activity retained scope

Kodein-DI-Android provides the `ActivityRetainedScope`, which is a scope that allows activity-scoped singletons or multitons that are independent from the activity restart.

This means that for the same activity, you'll get the same instance, even if the activity restarts.

CAUTION: This means that you *should never retain the activity* passed at creation because it may have been restarted and not valid anymore!

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using an Activity retained scope
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Controller>() with scoped(ActivityRetainedScope).singleton { ControllerImpl() }
}
----

NOTE: This scope *IS* compatible with `ScopeCloseable`: http://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/core#scope-closeable[see documentation].


=== Lifecycle scope

Kodein-DI-Android provides the `AndroidLifecycleScope`, which is a scope that allows activity-scoped singletons or multitons that are bound to a component lifecycle.
It uses Android support Lifecycle, so you need to use Android support's `LifecycleOwner` components.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using an Activity retained scope
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Controller>() with scoped(AndroidLifecycleScope<Fragment>()).singleton { ControllerImpl(context) }
}
----

NOTE: These lifecycles are *NOT* immune to activity restart due to configuration change.

NOTE: This scope *IS* compatible with `ScopeCloseable`: http://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/core#scope-closeable[see documentation].


== Layered dependencies

=== The closest DI pattern

Android components can be thought as layers.
For example, a `View` defines a layer, on top of an `Activity` layer, itself on top of the `Application` layer.

The `di` function will always return the DI container of the closest parent layer.
In a `View` or a `Fragment`, for example, it will return the containing Activity's DI container, if it defines one, else it will return the "global" Application DI container.

In the following code example, if `MyActivity` contains Fragments, and that these fragments get their DI object via `di()`, they will receive the `MyActivity` DI object, instead of the Application one.


=== Component based sub DI

In Android, each component has its own lifecycle, much like a "mini application".
You may need to have dependencies that are defined only inside a specific component and its subcomponents (such as an activity).
Kodein-DI allows you to create a `DI` instance that lives only inside one of your components:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: defining an Activity specific DI container
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {

    override val di by subDI(di()) { <1>
        /* activity specific bindings */
    }

}
----
<1> Creating a sub DI container that is valid for this activity and all components of this activity.

[NOTE]
====
By default all bindings are cached. You can also define the way the parent DI container is extended by defining the http://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/core#_overridden_access_from_parent[copy mode]. In below example each instance of activity will store a copy of the DI module (all bindings including `singleton` will be recreated per activity instance).

[source, kotlin]
.Example: defining an Activity specific DI container that copies all parent bindings
----
override val di by subDI(di(), copy = Copy.All) {
    /* component specific bindings */
}
----
====


=== Activity retained sub DI container

Kodein-DI-Android provides `retainedSubDI` for Activities.
It creates a DI object that is *immune to activity restarts*.

CAUTION: This means that you *should never access the containing activity* it may have been restarted and not valid anymore!

[source, kotlin]
.Example: defining an Activity specific DI container
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {

    override val di: DI by retainedSubDI(di()) { <1>
        /* activity specific bindings */
    }

}
----
<1> Using `retainedSubDI` instead of `subDI` ensures that the DI object is retained and not recreated between activity restarts.

[NOTE]
====
You can define the way the parent DI container is extended by defining the http://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/core#_overridden_access_from_parent[copy mode]:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: defining an Activity specific DI container that copies all parent bindings
----
override val di by retainedSubDI(di(), copy = Copy.All) {
    /* component specific bindings */
}
----
====


== Independant Activity retained DI container

Kodein-DI provides the `retainedDI` function that creates a DI instance that is _independendant from the parent_.

CAUTION: This means that all bindings in the application context are NOT available through this new DI container.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: defining an independant DI Container.
----
class MyActivity : Activity() {

    val activityKodein: DI by retainedDI { <1>
        /* activity specific bindings */
    }

}
----


== Kodein-DI in Android without the extension

=== Being DIAware

It is quite easy to have your Android components being `DIAware` (provided that your `Application` class is `DIAware`).


==== Using lazy

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a DIAware Activity
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {
    override val di: DI by lazy { (applicationContext as DIAware).di }
}
----


==== Using lateinit

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a DIAware Activity
----
class MyActivity : Activity(), DIAware {
    override lateinit var di: DI
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        di = (applicationContext as DIAware).di
    }
}
----


=== Using LateInitDI

If you don't want the component classes to be DIAware, you can use a `LateInitDI`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: an Activity with LateInitDI
----
class MyActivity : Activity() {
    val di = LateInitDI()
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        di.baseKodein = (applicationContext as DIAware).di
    }
}
----


=== Being Kodein-DI independant

[[dependency-holder]]
==== The dependency holder pattern

If you want your components to be Kodein-DI independent, you can use the dependency holder pattern:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: The dependency holder pattern
----
class MyActivity : Activity() {

    class Deps(
            val ds: DataSource,
            val ctrl: controller
    )

    val deps by lazy { (applicationContext as MyApplication).creator.myActivity() }

    val ds by lazy { deps.ds }
    val ctrl by lazy { deps.ctrl }

    /* ... */
}

class MyApplication : Application() {

	interface Creator {
	    fun myActivity(): MyActivity.Deps
	}

	val creator: Creator = DICreator()

    /* ... */
}

class DICreator : MyApplication.Creator {

    private val di = DI {
        /* bindings */
    }.direct

    override fun myActivity() = di.newInstance { MyActivity.Deps(instance(), instance()) }
}

----


[[view-model-factory]]
==== View Model Factory

If you want your view models to be independant from Kodein-DI, then you need to inject them (meaning passing their dependencies by constructor).
To do that, you need to create your own `ViewModelProvider.Factory`.

Here is a simple one:

[source, kotlin]
.A DI View Model Factory
----
class DIViewModelFactory(val di: DI) : ViewModelProvider.Factory {
    override fun <T : ViewModel> create(modelClass: Class<T>): T =
            di.direct.Instance(TT(modelClass))
}
----
