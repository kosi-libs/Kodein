= Kodein-DI on TornadoFX
:version: 7.1.0
:branch: 7.1

You can use Kodein-DI as-is in your TornadoFX project, but you can level-up your game by using the libraries `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm`.

NOTE: Kodein-DI does work on TornadoFX as-is.
      The `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm` extensions add multiple TornadoFX-specific utilities to Kodein-DI. +
      Using or not using this extension really depends on your needs.

Have a look at the https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-Samples/tree/master/di/tornadofx[TornadoFX demo project] to help you going further!

[[install]]
== Install

.How to quickly get into `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm`:
. Add those lines in your `dependencies` block in your application `build.gradle` file:
+
[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Groovy script
----
implementation 'kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm:{version}'
----
+
[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm:{version}")
----
+
. Declare your `App` as `DIAware` and implement a DI container
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: a TornadoFX Application declaration, `DIAware`, using TornadoFX DI as external source
----
class TornadoApplication : App(MainView::class), DIAware { // <1>
    override val di: DI get() = DI { // <2>
        installTornadoSource() // <3>
     }

}
----
<1> Setting the `App` as `DIAware` will help you define a global DI container
<2> Define a DI container, accessible from almost anywhere in your application
<3> Branch DI upon TornadoFX dependency injection, to be able to access those dependencies through your DI container (see https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/tornadofx#external-source[documentation])

WARNING: In order to leverage the power of DI and the helpers we made, you should really consider making your `App` as `DIAware`.

[[retrieving]]
== Retrieving

If you defined your `App` as `DIAware`, you will normally be able to retrieve a DI container, and dependencies, from almost anywhere in your code.

CAUTION: You may also want to access your TornadoFX components (such as `View`, `Fragment`, `Controller`, etc) through a DI container, to help you with that check the https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/tornadofx#external-source[external source] section.

[[closest-di]]
=== Closest DI pattern

The idea behind this concept, is to be able to retrieve a DI container, from an outer class. For example, making our `App` as `DIAware` give us the ability to have a global DI container that can be retrieve from multiple places, like:

- Components (`View`, `Fragment`, `Controller`, etc)
- Nodes, graphical object of the `App`

[[closest-tfx]]
==== From a TornadoFX perspective

In TornadoFX there is no hierarchy between the different components. In fact, their is no bound between `View`, `Fragment`, `Controller` or `ViewModel`, except if you handle it yourself. However, they are available through the DI container of TornadoFX (and the one of DI if you use https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/tornadofx#external-source[external source] helper), and they all have a reference to the `App`.

So, if we made our `App` as `DIAware`, we can get the global `DI` container from any `Component` thanks to:

[source, kotlin]
.Code: Extension function on `Component` that get the DI container from the `App`, if its `DIAware`
----
fun Component.kodeinDI() = kodeinDI { app }
----

[NOTE]
====
TornadoFX `Component` are:

- View
- Fragment
- Controller
- ViewModel
====

In your code you can access the global DI container like the following snippets.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through closest DI container from a `Controller`
----
class PersonController : Controller() {
    val repository: PersonRepository by kodeinDI().instance() // <1>
}
----
<1> The `kodeinDI()` function that will get the nearest DI container, from the `App`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through the closest DI container from a `View`
----
class PersonEditorView : View() {
    val controller: PersonController by kodeinDI().instance() // <1>
}
----
<1> The `kodeinDI()` function will get the nearest DI container, from the `App`

CAUTION: All TornadoFX `Component` can access the global DI container ) by calling the function `kodeinDI()`,
but in order to do that your `App` *must* be `DIAware`.

[[closest-jfx]]
==== From a JavaFX perspective

In JavaFX, an `Application` is made of a `Stage` (the window), a `Scene` (the container for all content) and a graph of `Node`. All `Node` are grouped by view (in the case of TornadoFX: `View` or `Fragment`).

So, the `Node` hierarchy can apply to the closest DI pattern, limited to the scope of a `View` or `Fragment` for now. If none of the parent `Node` have a `DI` container, thanks to the TornadoFX facilities, we can fallback onto the global DI container from the `App`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through the closest DI container from a `Node`
----
class EditorTabFragment : Fragment() {
    override val root = hbox {
        form {
            val author: String by kodeinDI().instance("author") // <1>
            label { author }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The `kodeinDI()` function will get the nearest DI container, from the parent `Node`, or from the `App`

CAUTION: If none of the parent nodes have a DI container, we try to get to the one in the `App`, only if this `App` is `DIAware`.

[[kodeinaware]]
==== Being DIAware

Having your classes set as `DIAware` have multiple advantages. For example this allow to cache the DI container or simplify the way we retrieve our dependencies.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: A DIAware TornadoFX Controller
----

class PersonListController : Controller(), DIAware { <1>
    override val di: DI = kodeinDI() <2>

    val personEditorController: PersonEditorController by instance() <3>

    fun editPerson(person: Person) {
        personEditorController.editPerson(person) <4>
    }
    /*...*/
}
----
<1> Set the Controller as `KodeeinAware`
<2> Retrieve the `App` DI container from the `kodeinDI()` extension function
<3> Retrieve dependency using the `instance()` function, as the DI container is part of the context
<4> Use the dependency

NOTE: Because DI is lazy, the container and the dependencies will be retrieve at call site only.

NOTE: To benefit from the DI optimization, and the facilities we provide, we highly recommend
that you make your classes `DIAware` when its possible.

[[di-extension]]
== Extension of Kodein-DI

This section will cover how we can extend the use of DI container in a TornadoFX application, like:

- Getting control of dependency injection over TornadoFX

- Defining specific DI containers in a TornadoFX / JavaFX graph

- Overriding a parent DI container in a TornadoFX component / JavaFX node

[[external-source]]
=== Using TornadoFX Dependency Injection as external source

TornadoFX integrates a dependency injection mechanism to work with its `Component`.
This section will show you how you can interact with the Tornado DI container, by using Kodein-DI.
Our goal is to provide you some tools to be able to integrate Kodein-DI as your main DI container,
thus by learning and knowing only one mechanism.

- Defining the external source
+
In order to use Kodein-DI upon TornadoFX you should make your `App` as `DIAware`,
then by using the `installTornadoSource()` extension function, in your `di` property override,
you'll be able to get through the external source from anywhere in your `App`.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Installing the TornadoFX DI container as external source for Kodein-DI
----
class TornadoApplication : App(MainView::class), DIAware {
    override val di: DI = DI {
        installTornadoSource() // <1>
     }

}
----
<1> Branch DI upon TornadoFX dependency injection, to be able to access those dependencies through your DI container
+
WARNING: We highly recommend that you make your `App` as `DIAware` in order to benefit from the use of Kodein-DI upon TornadoFX DI container.

- Retrieving TornadoFX `Component` through Kodein-DI
+
Once you'll have installed the TornadoFX source, you will be able to retrieve transparently TornadoFX `Component` through Kodein-DI,
as it were one of your own dependencies.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving a Component from DI
----
class PersonListController : Controller() { ... } <1>
class PersonListView : View() {
    private val listController: PersonListController by kodeinDI().instance() <2>
}
----
<1> `PersonListController` is not bound on the DI container, but as a `Controller` its accessible from TornadoFX DI container
<2>  Retrieve `PersonListController` through the DI external source

- Using TornadoFX scopes to retrieve binding through the external source
+
Like Kodein-DI, TornadoFX as scopes to contextualize and attach state to its dependencies.
As we can retrieve TornadoFX dependencies through DI external source,
we also can retrieve them using scopes with DI.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving a Component from DI with a Scope
----
class PersonScope(person: Person) : Scope() { <1>
    val model = PersonModel(person)
}
//...
class EditorTabFragment : Fragment() {
    override val scope = super.scope as PersonScope <2>
}
//...
val editor: EditorTabFragment by kodeinDI().on(personScope).instance() <3>
//...
----
<1> Define a `Scope` that will help contextualize `Component`
<2> Every `Component` has a scope that can be override, this allow TornadoFX to handle multiple instances with multiple contexts
<3> We can retrieve a scoped instance of `EditorTabFragment` with the function `on(personScope)`, where personScope is a `PersonScope`

[[fx-container]]
=== Defining DI container in FX's `Node`

For some need we could want to define DI containers into the `Node` hierarchy. To do so we provide an extension function to create a DI container attached to a `Node`. This is done by adding the DI container to the properties of the `Node`, thus we will be able to access it from any child in the hierarchy.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining and using a DI container from a `Node`
----
class MyView : View() {
    override val root = hbox { // <1>
        kodeinDI { // <2>
            bind<Random>() with singleton { SecureRandom() }
        }

        form { // <3>
            val random by kodeinDI().instance<Random>() // <4>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defining the root `Node` for a `View`
<2> Declaring a *new* DI container into the root `Node`, with its binding
<3> Defining a child `Node`
<4> Calling the `kodeinDI()` extension function to access the nearest DI container, in this case the one defined at <2>, then retrieve a dependency

IMPORTANT: This feature will provide a *new* DI container, meaning it won't be linked to other DI container, such as your global one.
To keep your binding from the global DI container you can use https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/tornadofx#kodein-extension[extension] or following the next about https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/tornadofx#sub-kodein[subDI]

[[sub-di]]
=== Extending the nearest DI container

Some times, we might want to extend an existing DI container in a dedicated area, without impacting the whole application. For example, in a login form, we might want to have credentials binding, that would be only available on this form and its children.

To do so, we have facilities to extend a DI container by calling the `subDI` extension function, available on `Component` and `Node` classes.

. In the case of a `Component`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Extending the nearest DI container for a `Component`
----
class LoginController : Controller(), DIAware { // <1>
    override val di: DI = subDI { // <2>
            bind<CredentialsDao> with singleton { CredentialsDao() } <3>
    }

    // ...

    val dao by instance<CredentialsDao>() // <4>
}
----
<1> Defining your `Component` as `DIAware` will help keeping track of your extended DI container
<2> Extending the nearest DI container, here the `App` one
<3> Defining binding only available for the extended DI container
<4> Retrieve the `CredentialsDao` from the local DI container
+
NOTE: Making your `Component` as `DIAware` is *optional*, but it will help you keeping track of your extended container. Otherwise, you might want to store a reference of your extended container in a local variable.

. In the case of a `Node` hierarchy
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Extending the nearest DI container for a `Node`
----
class LoginView : View() {
    override val root = hbox { // <1>
        subDI { // <2>
            bind<LoginController>() with singleton { instance() } // <3>
        }

        form {
            val controller by kodeinDI().instance<LoginController>() <4>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defining the root `Node` for a `View`
<2> Extending the nearest DI container, here the `App` one, but stored in the `Node` properties
<3> Defining binding only available for the extended DI container
<4> Retrieve the `CredentialsDao` from the nearest DI container, in that case the extended container stored in the *hbox* properties

IMPORTANT: In the case of a `Component` you have to handle the reference of the extended container yourself. But, in the case of a `Node` the `subDI` will manage it, by storing the reference to the extended container, into the `Node` properties, like for the https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?{branch}/tornadofx#fx-container[FX container feature]

[[scopes]]
== TornadoFX scopes

DI-DI provides a standard scope for any object (TornadoFX or not).
The `WeakContextScope` will keep singleton and multiton instances as long as the context (= object) lives.

That's why the `ComponentScope` and `NodeScope` are just wrappers upon `WeakContextScope` with the respective targets `Component` and `Node`.

- `ComponentScope`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining `Component` scoped dependencies
----
val di = DI {
    bind<EditingState>() with scoped(ComponentScope).singleton { EditingState() } <1>
}
----
<1> A `EditingState` object will be created for each Component that will ask for.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving `Component scoped dependencies
----
class EditorTabFragment : Fragment() {
    private val editingState: EditingState by kodeinDI().on(this).instance() <1>
}
----
<1> Scope is `this`

- `NodeScope`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining `Node` scoped dependencies
----
val di = DI {
    bind<EditingState>() with scoped(NodeScope).singleton { EditingState() } <1>
}
----
<1> A `EditingState` object will be created for each `Node` that will ask for.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving `Node scoped dependencies
----
class PersonEditorController : Controller() {
    val personEditorView: PersonEditorView by kodeinDI().instance()

    fun editPerson(person: Person) {
        val tab = personEditorView.tabPane.tab("Tab Title")
        val editingState: EditingState by kodeinDI().on(tab).instance() <1>
    }
}
----
<1> Scope is *tab* a `Node` element, every `Tab` would have a different instance of `EditingState`
