= Kodein DI on TornadoFX
:version: 6.5.5
:branch: 6.5

You can use Kodein as-is in your TornadoFX project, but you can level-up your game by using the libraries `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm`.

NOTE: Kodein does work on TornadoFX as-is.
      The `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm` extensions add multiple TornadoFX-specific utilities to Kodein. +
      Using or not using this extension really depends on your needs.

Have a look at the https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-Samples/tree/master/di/tornadofx[TornadoFX demo project] to help you going further!

[[install]]
== Install

.How to quickly get into `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm`:
. Add those lines in your `dependencies` block in your application `build.gradle` file:
+
[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Groovy script
----
implementation 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-generic-jvm:{version}'
implementation 'kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm:{version}'
----
+
[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-generic-jvm:{version}")
implementation("kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm:{version}")
----
+
IMPORTANT: either `kodein-di-generic-jvm` or `kodein-di-erased` *must* be declared in addition to the `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-jvm` package.
+
. Declare your `App` as `KodeinAware` and implement a Kodein container
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: a TornadoFX Application declaration, `KodeinAware`, using TornadoFX DI as external source
----
class TornadoApplication : App(MainView::class), KodeinAware { // <1>
    override val kodein: Kodein get() = Kodein { // <2>
        installTornadoSource() // <3>
     }

}
----
<1> Setting the `App` as `KodeinAware` will help you define a global Kodein container
<2> Define a Kodein container, accessible from almost anywhere in your application
<3> Branch Kodein upon TornadoFX dependency injection, to be able to access those dependencies through your Kodein container (see xref:external-source[documentation])

WARNING: In order to leverage the power of Kodein and the helpers we made, you should really consider making your `App` as `KodeinAware`.

[[retrieving]]
== Retrieving

If you defined your `App` as `KodeinAware`, you will normally be able to retrieve a Kodein container, and dependencies, from almost anywhere in your code.

CAUTION: You may also want to access your TornadoFX components (such as `View`, `Fragment`, `Controller`, etc) through a Kodein container, to help you with that check the xref:external-source[external source] section.

[[closest-kodein]]
=== Closest Kodein pattern

The idea behind this concept, is to be able to retrieve a Kodein container, from an outer class. For example, making our `App` as `KodeinAware` give us the ability to have a global Kodein container that can be retrieve from multiple places, like:

- Components (`View`, `Fragment`, `Controller`, etc)
- Nodes, graphical object of the `App`

[[closest-tfx]]
==== From a TornadoFX perspective

In TornadoFX there is no hierarchy between the different components. In fact, their is no bound between `View`, `Fragment`, `Controller` or `ViewModel`, except if you handle it yourself. However, they are available through the DI container of TornadoFX (and the one of Kodein if you use xref:external-source[external source] helper), and they all have a reference to the `App`.

So, if we made our `App` as `KodeinAware`, we can get the global `Kodein` container from any `Component` thanks to:

[source, kotlin]
.Code: Extension function on `Component` that get the Kodein container from the `App`, if its `KodeinAware`
----
fun Component.kodein() = kodein { app }
----

[NOTE]
====
TornadoFX `Component` are:

- View
- Fragment
- Controller
- ViewModel
====

In your code you can access the global Kodein container like the following snippets.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through closest Kodein container from a `Controller`
----
class PersonController : Controller() {
    val repository: PersonRepository by kodein().instance() // <1>
}
----
<1> The `kodein()` function that will get the nearest Kodein container, from the `App`

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through the closest Kodein container from a `View`
----
class PersonEditorView : View() {
    val controller: PersonController by kodein().instance() // <1>
}
----
<1> The `kodein()` function will get the nearest Kodein container, from the `App`

CAUTION: All TornadoFX `Component` can access the global Kodein container ) by calling the function `kodein()`,
but in order to do that your `App` *must* be `KodeinAware`.

[[closest-jfx]]
==== From a JavaFX perspective

In JavaFX, an `Application` is made of a `Stage` (the window), a `Scene` (the container for all content) and a graph of `Node`. All `Node` are grouped by view (in the case of TornadoFX: `View` or `Fragment`).

So, the `Node` hierarchy can apply to the closest Kodein pattern, limited to the scope of a `View` or `Fragment` for now. If none of the parent `Node` have a `Kodein` container, thanks to the TornadoFX facilities, we can fallback onto the global Kodein container from the `App`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through the closest Kodein container from a `Node`
----
class EditorTabFragment : Fragment() {
    override val root = hbox {
        form {
            val author: String by kodein().instance("author") // <1>
            label { author }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The `kodein()` function will get the nearest Kodein container, from the parent `Node`, or from the `App`

CAUTION: If none of the parent nodes have a Kodein container, we try to get to the one in the `App`, only if this `App` is `KodeinAware`.

[[kodeinaware]]
==== Being KodeinAware

Having your classes set as `KodeinAware` have multiple advantages. For example this allow to cache the Kodein container or simplify the way we retrieve our dependencies.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: A KodeinAware TornadoFX Controller
----

class PersonListController : Controller(), KodeinAware { <1>
    override val kodein: Kodein = kodein() <2>

    val personEditorController: PersonEditorController by instance() <3>

    fun editPerson(person: Person) {
        personEditorController.editPerson(person) <4>
    }
    /*...*/
}
----
<1> Set the Controller as `KodeeinAware`
<2> Retrieve the `App` Kodein container from the `kodein()` extension function
<3> Retrieve dependency using the `instance()` function, as the Kodein container is part of the context
<4> Use the dependency

NOTE: Because Kodein is lazy, the container and the dependencies will be retrieve at call site only.

NOTE: To benefit from the Kodein optimization, and the facilities we provide, we highly recommend
that you make your classes `KodeinAware` when its possible.

[[kodein-extension]]
== Extension of Kodein

This section will cover how we can extend the use of Kodein in a TornadoFX application, like:

- Getting control of dependency injection over TornadoFX

- Defining specific Kodein containers in a TornadoFX / JavaFX graph

- Overriding a parent Kodein container in a TornadoFX component / JavaFX node

[[external-source]]
=== Using TornadoFX Dependency Injection as external source

TornadoFX integrates a dependency injection mechanism to work with its `Component`.
This section will show you how you can interact with the Tornado DI container, by using Kodein.
Our goal is to provide you some tools to be able to integrate Kodein as your main DI container,
thus by learning and knowing only one mechanism.

- Defining the external source
+
In order to use Kodein upon TornadoFX you should make your `App` as `KodeinAware`,
then by using the `installTornadoSource()` extension function, in your `kodein` property override,
you'll be able to get through the external source from anywhere in your `App`.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Installing the TornadoFX DI container as external source for Kodein
----
class TornadoApplication : App(MainView::class), KodeinAware {
    override val kodein: Kodein = Kodein {
        installTornadoSource() // <1>
     }

}
----
<1> Branch Kodein upon TornadoFX dependency injection, to be able to access those dependencies through your Kodein container
+
WARNING: We highly recommend that you make your `App` as `KodeinAware` in order to benefit from the use of Kodein upon TornadoFX DI container.

- Retrieving TornadoFX `Component` through Kodein
+
Once you'll have installed the TornadoFX source, you will be able to retrieve transparently TornadoFX `Component` through Kodein,
as it were one of your own dependencies.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving a Component from Kodein
----
class PersonListController : Controller() { ... } <1>
class PersonListView : View() {
    private val listController: PersonListController by kodein().instance() <2>
}
----
<1> `PersonListController` is not bound on the Kodein container, but as a `Controller` its accessible from TornadoFX DI container
<2>  Retrieve `PersonListController` through the Kodein external source

- Using TornadoFX scopes to retrieve binding through the external source
+
Like Kodein, TornadoFX as scopes to contextualize and attach state to its dependencies.
As we can retrieve TornadoFX dependencies through Kodein external source,
we also can retrieve them using scopes with Kodein.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving a Component from Kodein with a Scope
----
class PersonScope(person: Person) : Scope() { <1>
    val model = PersonModel(person)
}
//...
class EditorTabFragment : Fragment() {
    override val scope = super.scope as PersonScope <2>
}
//...
val editor: EditorTabFragment by kodein().on(personScope).instance() <3>
//...
----
<1> Define a `Scope` that will help contextualize `Component`
<2> Every `Component` has a scope that can be override, this allow TornadoFX to handle multiple instances with multiple contexts
<3> We can retrieve a scoped instance of `EditorTabFragment` with the function `on(personScope)`, where personScope is a `PersonScope`

[[fx-container]]
=== Defining Kodein container in FX's `Node`

For some need we could want to define Kodein containers into the `Node` hierarchy. To do so we provide an extension function to create a Kodein container attached to a `Node`. This is done by adding the Kodein container to the properties of the `Node`, thus we will be able to access it from any child in the hierarchy.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining and using a Kodein container from a `Node`
----
class MyView : View() {
    override val root = hbox { // <1>
        kodein { // <2>
            bind<Random>() with singleton { SecureRandom() }
        }

        form { // <3>
            val random by kodein().instance<Random>() // <4>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defining the root `Node` for a `View`
<2> Declaring a *new* Kodein container into the root `Node`, with its binding
<3> Defining a child `Node`
<4> Calling the `kodein()` extension function to access the nearest Kodein container, in this case the one defined at <2>, then retrieve a dependency

IMPORTANT: This feature will provide a *new* Kodein container, meaning it won't be linked to other Kodein container, such as your global one.
To keep your binding from the global Kodein container you can use xref:kodein-extension[extension] or following the next about xref:sub-kodein[subKodein]

[[sub-kodein]]
=== Extending the nearest Kodein container

Some times, we might want to extend an existing Kodein container in a dedicated area, without impacting the whole application. For example, in a login form, we might want to have credentials binding, that would be only available on this form and its children.

To do so, we have facilities to extend a Kodein container by calling the `subKodein` extension function, available on `Component` and `Node` classes.

. In the case of a `Component`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Extending the nearest Kodein container for a `Component`
----
class LoginController : Controller(), KodeinAware { // <1>
    override val kodein: Kodein = subKodein { // <2>
            bind<CredentialsDao> with singleton { CredentialsDao() } <3>
    }

    // ...

    val dao by instance<CredentialsDao>() // <4>
}
----
<1> Defining your `Component` as `KodeinAware` will help keeping track of your extended Kodein container
<2> Extending the nearest Kodein container, here the `App` one
<3> Defining binding only available for the extended Kodein container
<4> Retrieve the `CredentialsDao` from the local Kodein container
+
NOTE: Making your `Component` as `KodeinAware` is *optional*, but it will help you keeping track of your extended container. Otherwise, you might want to store a reference of your extended container in a local variable.

. In the case of a `Node` hierarchy
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Extending the nearest Kodein container for a `Node`
----
class LoginView : View() {
    override val root = hbox { // <1>
        subKodein { // <2>
            bind<LoginController>() with singleton { instance() } // <3>
        }

        form {
            val controller by kodein().instance<LoginController>() <4>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defining the root `Node` for a `View`
<2> Extending the nearest Kodein container, here the `App` one, but stored in the `Node` properties
<3> Defining binding only available for the extended Kodein container
<4> Retrieve the `CredentialsDao` from the nearest Kodein container, in that case the extended container stored in the *hbox* properties

IMPORTANT: In the case of a `Component` you have to handle the reference of the extended container yourself. But, in the case of a `Node` the `subKodein` will manage it, by storing the reference to the extended container, into the `Node` properties, like for the xref:fx-container[FX container feature]

[[scopes]]
== TornadoFX scopes

Kodein provides a standard scope for any object (TornadoFX or not).
The `WeakContextScope` will keep singleton and multiton instances as long as the context (= object) lives.

That's why the `ComponentScope` and `NodeScope` are just wrappers upon `WeakContextScope` with the respective targets `Component` and `Node`.

- `ComponentScope`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining `Component` scoped dependencies
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<EditingState>() with scoped(ComponentScope).singleton { EditingState() } <1>
}
----
<1> A `EditingState` object will be created for each Component that will ask for.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving `Component scoped dependencies
----
class EditorTabFragment : Fragment() {
    private val editingState: EditingState by kodein().on(this).instance() <1>
}
----
<1> Scope is `this`

- `NodeScope`
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Defining `Node` scoped dependencies
----
val kodein = Kodein {
    bind<EditingState>() with scoped(NodeScope).singleton { EditingState() } <1>
}
----
<1> A `EditingState` object will be created for each `Node` that will ask for.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: Retrieving `Node scoped dependencies
----
class PersonEditorController : Controller() {
    val personEditorView: PersonEditorView by kodein().instance()

    fun editPerson(person: Person) {
        val tab = personEditorView.tabPane.tab("Tab Title")
        val editingState: EditingState by kodein().on(tab).instance() <1>
    }
}
----
<1> Scope is *tab* a `Node` element, every `Tab` would have a different instance of `EditingState`
