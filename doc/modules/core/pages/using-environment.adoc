= Using the environment

Binding functions have access to the environment where the bound type is retrieved to be able to create it accordingly.

[#context]
== Context

[.lead]
This environment is represented as a *context* variable.

The context is an object that is explicitly defined by the programmer for this retrieval or the receiving object when none is explicitely defined.

There are two very important differences between a tag and a context:

- The tag *instance* identifies the binding but can not be used in the binding function.
- The context *type* identifies the binding and it's *instance* can be used in the binding function.

There are also two very important differences between a factory argument and a context:

- The context is defined _before_ retrieving the binding function while the factory argument is the last known variable.
- A context is usually global to an entire class while a factory argument is local to a retrieval.

TIP: When in doubt, use a factory with an argument instead of a provider with a context.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: binding in a context
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Writer>() with contexted<Request>.provider { context.response.writer } // <1>
}
----
<1> note that `context` is already of type `Request`.


[#scope]
== Scope

[NOTE]
====
_Kodein-DI_ provides only 1 scope by default, but:

- It is easy to create your own scopes.
- All `kodein-framework-*` modules provide more scopes that are specific to the target framework.
====

Scopes are derived from a context variable.
They allow a singleton or multiton objects to exist multiple times in different contexts. +
They are of type `Scope<C>` where `C` is the context type.

Think, for example, of a session object inside a web server.
We can say that there can be only one user per session, and therefore define a `User` singleton scoped in a session.
Therefore, the provided function will be called *once per session*.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding a User in a Session scope.
----
val di = DI {
    bind<User>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { UserData(session.userId) } // <1>
}
----
<1> note that `SessionScope` does not really exist, it is an example.

In this example, `SessionScope` is of type `Scope<Session>`, so to access this binding, the user will either have retrieve it inside the session object or explicitly define a `Session` context:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binding in a context
----
val user by di.on(session).instance()
----

NOTE: Please read the <<scope-creation>> section if you want to create your own scopes.


[[scope-closeable]]
=== Scope closeable

By default, a Singleton or a Multiton value will never expire.
However, the purpose of a Scope is to handle the lifecycle of a long lived value.
Therefore, it is possible for a scoped Singleton or Multiton value to expire (most of the time because the scope itself expires).
For example, in android's `ActivityRetainedScope`, scoped values will only live the duration of the activity.

If a value implements `ScopeCloseable`, it's `close` function will be called when the value is removed from the scope (or when the scope itself expires).

[CAUTION]
====
The `ScopeCloseable.close` method will only be called:

- By scopes that explicitely *support* that feature (not all scopes do, all scopes provided by the _Kodein-DI_ Framework do *except WeakContextScope*).
- If the value does *not* use `WeakRef` or `SoftRef` references. +
If the value does, the close method _may or may not_ be called (it will be called if the reference has not expired).
====


=== JVM references in scopes

Yes, you can...

[source, kotlin]
.Example: JVM scoped weak references.
----
val di = DI {
    bind<User>() with scoped(requestScope).singleton(ref = weakReference) {
        instance<DataSource>().createUser(context.session.id)
    } // <1>
}
----


=== Weak Context Scope

_Kodein-DI_ provides the `WeakContextScope` scope.
This is a particular scope, as the context it holds on are weak references.

CAUTION: WeakContextScope is *NOT* compatible with `ScopeCloseable`.

You can use this scope when it makes sense to have a scope on a context that is held by the system for the duration of its life cycle.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: controller scoped to an Activity with WeakContextScope.
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Controller>() with scoped(WeakContextScope.of<Activity>()).singleton { ControllerImpl(context) } // <1>
}
----
<1> `context` is of type `Activity` because we are using the `WeakContextScope.of<Activity>()`.

`WeakContextScope.of` will always return the same scope, which you should never clean!

If you need a compartimentalized scope which you can clean, you can create a new `WeakContextScope`:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: creating a WeakContextScope.
----
val activityScope = WeakContextScope<Activity>()
----


=== Context translators

Let's get back to the web server example.
There is one session per user, so we have bound a `User` singleton inside a `Session` scope.
As each `Request` is associated with a `Session`, you can register a context translator that will make any binding that needs a `Session` context work with a `Request` context:

[source, kotlin]
.Example:
----
val di = DI {
    bind<User>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { UserData(session.userId) }

    registerContextTranslator { r: Request -> r.session }
}
----

This allows you to retrieve a `User` instance:

- When there is a global `Request` context:
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: retriving with a global context
----
class MyController(override val di: DI, request: Request): DIAware {
    override val diContext = kcontext(request)

    val user: User by instance()
}
----
- When the retrieval happens on a `Request` itself:
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: retriving with a global context
----
class MySpecialRequest(override val di: DI): Request(), DIAware {
    val user: User by instance()
}
----


=== Context finder

A context finder is a similar to context translator, except that it gets the context from a global context.

For example, if you are in a thread-based server where each request is assigned a thread (are people still doing those?!?), you could get the session from a global:

[source, kotlin]
.Example:
----
val di = DI {
    bind<User>() with scoped(SessionScope).singleton { UserData(session.userId) }

    registerContextFinder { ThreadLocalSession.get() }
}
----

This allows to access a `User` object wihout specifying a context.

TIP: Having an other type of context declared will not block from using a context finder.


[[scope-creation]]
== Scope creation

Scoped singletons/multitons are bound to a context and live while that context exists.

To define a scope that can contain scoped singletons or multitons, you must define an object that implements the `Scope` interface.
This object will be responsible for providing a `ScopeRegistry` according to a context.
It should always return the same `ScopeRegistry` when given the same context object.
A standard way of doing so is to use the `userData` property of the context, if it has one, or else to use a `WeakHashMap<C, ScopeRegistry>`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a simple session scope
----
object SessionScope : Scope<Session> { <1>
    override fun getRegistry(context: Session): ScopeRegistry =
            context.userData as? ScopeRegistry
                ?: StandardScopeRegistry().also { context.userData = it } // <2>
}
----
<1> The scope's context type is `Session`.
<2> Creates a `ScopeRegistry` and attach it to the `Session` if there is none.

IMPORTANT: Scope providers should also provide standard context translators. +
In this example, we should provide, along with `sessionScope` a module providing the `Request` to `Session` context translator.

[[scope-registry]]
=== Scope registry

The `ScopeRegistry` is responsible for holding value instances.
It is also responsible for calling the `close` methods on object that are `ScopeCloseable` when they are removed from the registry.

IMPORTANT: To have your scope compatible with `ScopeCloseable` values, make sure to `clean` the registry when the scope expires.

There are two standard implementations of `ScopeRegistry`:


=== StandardScopeRegistry

This is the "classic" expected `ScopeRegistry` behaviour.


=== SingleItemScopeRegistry

This is a particular `ScopeRegistry` implementation : it will only hold one item and replace the held item if the binding asks for an instance of another binding.

This means that a Multiton scoped with a Scope that uses a `SingleItemScopeRegistry` will actually hold only one instance: the one corresponding to the last argument.

CAUTION: You should NOT use this registry unless you know exactly WHAT you are doing, and WHY you are doing it.


=== Sub-scopes

You can define a scope to be defined inside another scope.
This means that when the parent scope clears, so does all of its subscopes.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a simple session scope
----
val requestScope = object : SubScope<Request, Session>(sessionScope) {
    override fun getParentContext(context: Request) = context.session
}
----

In this simple example, when the session expires, then all of its associates request scoped values also expire.
