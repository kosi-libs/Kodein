= Modules & inheritance

[[modules]]
== Modules

=== Definition

_Kodein-DI_ allows you to export your bindings in modules.
It is very useful to have separate modules defining their own bindings instead of having only one central binding definition.
A module is an object that you can construct the exact same way as you construct a DI instance.


[source, kotlin]
.Example: a simple module
----
val apiModule = DI.Module(name = "API") {
    bind<API>() with singleton { APIImpl() }
    /* other bindings */
}
----

Then, in your DI binding block:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports the module
----
val di = DI {
    import(apiModule)
    /* other bindings */
}
----

NOTE: Modules are *definitions*, they will re-declare their bindings in each DI instance you use.
If you create a module that defines a singleton and import that module into two different DI instances, then the singleton object will exist twice: once in each DI instance.


[[module-uniqueness]]
=== Name uniqueness

Each module name should only be imported once.

If a second module with the name of an already imported module is imported, then _Kodein-DI_ will fail.

However, you cannot always ensure that every module name is unique: you may need to import modules that are defined outside of your code.
_Kodein-DI_ offers two ways to mitigate that:

1. Rename a module: +
Use when you are importing a module whose name already exists.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports a renamed module
----
val di = DI {
    import(apiModule.copy(name = "otherAPI"))
}
----
+
2. Add a prefix to modules imported by a module: +
Use when a module imported by another module uses a names which already exists.
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports a module with a prefix for sub-modules
----
val di = DI {
    import(apiModule.copy(prefix = "otherAPI-"))
}
----


=== Import once

You may define a module which you know depends on another module, so it would be great to import that dependency inside the module that has the dependency.
However, each module can only be imported once, so if every module that depends on another module imports it, _Kodein-DI_ will fail at the second module that imports it.

To support this, _Kodein-DI_ offers `importOnce`: it imports the module if no module with that name was previously imported.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: importing a module only once
----
val appModule = DI.Module {
    importOnce(apiModule)
}
----


[[extension-composition]]
== Extension (composition)

_Kodein-DI_ allows you to create a new DI instance by extending an existing one.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: extends an already existing DI instance
----
val subDI = DI {
    extend(appDI)
    /* other bindings */
}
----

NOTE: This *preserves bindings*, meaning that a singleton in the parent DI will continue to exist only once.
Both parent and child DI objects will give the same instance.


== Overriding

By default, overriding a binding is not allowed in _Kodein-DI_.
That is because accidentally binding twice the same (class,tag) to different instances/providers/factories can cause real headaches to debug.

However, when intended, it can be really interesting to override a binding, especially when creating a testing environment.
You can override an existing binding by specifying explicitly that it is an override.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: binds twice the same type, the second time explitly specifying an override
----
val di = DI {
    bind<API>() with singleton { APIImpl() }
    /* ... */
    bind<API>(overrides = true) with singleton { OtherAPIImpl() }
}
----

By default, *modules are not allowed to override, _even explicitly_*.
You can allow a module to override some of your bindings when you import it (the same goes for extension):

[source, kotlin]
.Example: imports a module and giving it the right to override existing bindings.
----
val di = DI {
    /* ... */
    import(testEnvModule, allowOverride = true)
}
----

WARNING: The bindings in the module still need to specify explicitly the overrides.

Sometimes, you just want to define bindings without knowing if you are actually overriding a previous binding or defining a new.
Those cases should be rare and you should know what you are doing.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: declaring a module in which each binding may or may not override existing bindings.
----
val testModule = DI.Module(name = "test", allowSilentOverride = true) {
    bind<EmailClient>() with singleton { MockEmailClient() } // <1>
}
----
<1> Maybe adding a new binding, maybe overriding an existing one, who knows?

If you want to access an instance retrieved by the overridden binding, you can use overriddenInstance.
This is useful if you want to "enhance" a binding (for example, using the decorator pattern).

[source,kotlin]
.Example: declaring a module in which each binding may or may not override existing bindings.
----
val testModule = DI.Module(name = "test") {
    bind<Logger>(overrides = true) with singleton { FileLoggerWrapper("path/to/file", overriddenInstance()) } // <1>
}
----
<1> `overriddenInstance()` will return the `Logger` instance retrieved by the overridden binding.


[#overridden_access_from_parent]
== Overridden access from parent

Let's consider the following code :

[source,kotlin]
.Example: Mixing overriding & extension
----
val parent = DI {
    bind<Foo>() with provider { Foo1() }
    bind<Bar>() with singleton { Bar(foo = instance<Foo>()) }
}

val child = DI {
    extend(parent)
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo2() }
}

val foo = child.instance<Bar>().foo
----

In this example, the `foo` variable will be of type `Foo1`.
Because the `Bar` binding is a `singleton` and is declared in the `parent` _Kodein-DI_, it *does not have access to bindings declared in `child`.*
In this example, both `parent.instance<Bar>().foo` and `child.instance<Bar>().foo` will yield a `Foo1` object.

NOTE: This is because `Bar` is bound to a `singleton`, the first access would define the container used (`parent` or `child`).
If the singleton were initialized by `child`, then a subsequent access from `parent` would yeild a `Bar` with a reference to a `Foo2`, which is not supposed to exist in `parent`.

IMPORTANT: By default, *all bindings that do not cache instances* (basically all bindings but `singleton` and `multiton`) *are copied by default into the new container*, and therefore have access to the bindings & overrides of this new container.

If you want the `Bar` singleton to have access to the overridden `Foo` binding, you need to copy it into the `child` container.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying the bar binding into the child container
----
val child = DI {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy {
        copy the binding<Bar>() <1>
    })
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo2() }
}
----

CAUTION: Copying a binding means that it will exists once more.
Therefore, a copied singleton will *no longer be unique* and have TWO instances, one managed by each binding (the original and the copied).

If the binding you need to copy is bound by a context (such as a scoped singleton), you need to specify it:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying a tagged scoped singleton
----
val parent = DI {
    bind<Session>(tag = "req") with scoped(requestScope).singleton { context.session() }
}

val child = DI {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy {
        copy the binding<Session>() with scope(requestScope) and tag("req")
    })
    bind<Foo>(overrides = true) with provider { Foo2() }
}
----

NOTE: You can use the `context<>()`, `scope()` and `tag()` functions to specialise your binding copies.

You can also copy all bindings that matches a particular definition :

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying all that matches
----
val child = DI {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy {
        copy all binding<String>() <1>
        copy all scope(requestScope) <2>
    })
}
----
<1> Will copy all bindings for a `String`, with or without a context, scope, tag or argument.
<2> Will copy all bindings that are scoped inside a `RequestScope`.

Finally, you can simply copy *all* bindings:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying all
----
val child = DI {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy.All)
}
----

Or you can decide that none are copied (if you do want existing bindings to have access to new bindings):

[source, kotlin]
.Example: Copying none
----
val child = DI {
    extend(parent, copy = Copy.None)
}
----
