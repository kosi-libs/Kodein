= Bindings: Declaring dependencies

[source,kotlin]
.Example: initialization of a DI container
----
val di = DI {
	/* Bindings */
}
----

Bindings are declared inside a DI initialization block.

A binding always starts with `bind<TYPE>() with`.

[.lead]
There are different ways to declare bindings:


[[tagged-bindings]]
== Tagged bindings

All bindings can be tagged to allow you to bind different instances of the same type.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: different Dice bindings
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Dice>() with ... // <1>
    bind<Dice>(tag = "DnD10") with ... // <2>
    bind<Dice>(tag = "DnD20") with ... // <2>
}
----
<1> Default binding (with no tag)
<2> Bindings with tags (`"DnD10"` and `"DnD20"`)

TIP: The tag is of type `Any`, it does not have to be a `String`.

TIP: Whether at define, at injection or at retrieval, `tag` should always be passed as a named argument.

IMPORTANT: Tag objects must support equality & hashcode comparison.
It is therefore recommended to either use primitives (Strings, Ints, etc.) or data classes.

[[provider-bindings]]
== Provider binding

This binds a type to a provider function, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns an object of the bound type (eg. `() -> T`). +
The provided function will be called *each time* you need an instance of the bound type.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new 6 sided Dice entry each time you need one
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Dice>() with provider { RandomDice(6) }
}
----

[[singleton-bindings]]
== Singleton binding

This binds a type to an instance of this type that will lazily be created at first use via a singleton function, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns an object of the bound type (eg. `() -> T`). +
Therefore, the provided function will be called *only once*: the first time an instance is needed.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a DataSource singleton that will be initialized on first access
----
val di = DI {
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----


=== Non-synced singleton

By definition, there can be only one instance of a singleton, which means only one instance can be constructed.
To achieve this certainty, _Kodein-DI_ synchronizes construction.
This means that, when a singleton instance is requested and not available, _Kodein-DI_ uses a synchronization mutex to ensure that other request to the same type will wait for this instance to be constructed.

While this behaviour is the only way to ensure the singleton's correctness, it is also costly (due to the mutex) and degrades startup performance.

If you need to improve startup performance, _if you know what you are doing_, you can disable this synchronization.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a DataSource non synced singleton
----
val di = DI {
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton(sync = false) { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----

Using `sync = false` means that:

- There will be no construction synchronicity.
- There _may_ be multiple instance constructed.
- Instance will be _reused_ as much as possible.


=== Eager singleton

This is the same as a regular singleton, except that the provided function will be called as soon as the DI instance is created and all bindings are defined.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a DataSource singleton that will be initialized as soon as the binding block ends
----
val di = DI {
    // The SQLite connection will be opened as soon as the di instance is ready
    bind<DataSource>() with eagerSingleton { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}
----

[[factory-bindings]]
== Factory binding

This binds a type to a factory function, which is a function that takes an argument of a defined type and that returns an object of the bound type (eg. `(A) -> T`). +
The provided function will be called *each time* you need an instance of the bound type.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new Dice each time you need one, according to an Int representing the number of sides
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { sides: Int -> RandomDice(sides) }
}
----


[[multi-argument-factories]]
=== Multi-arguments factories

CAUTION: This multi-agrument-factories mechanism is deprecated and will be removed in version `7.0`

A factory can take multiple (up to 5) arguments:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new Dice each time you need one, according to an Int representing the number of sides
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { startNumber: Int, sides: Int -> RandomDice(sides) }
}
----

NOTE: We recommend to use `data classes` instead!

Regarding our users feedback, we find out that multi-arguments factories was difficult to use.

Thus this mechanism will be deprecate soon. So we highly recommend that you migrate your multi-args factories to simple factories by using *data classes*.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a new Dice each time you need one, according to multiple parameters
----
data class DiceParams(val startNumber: Int, val sides: Int)

val di = DI {
    bind<Dice>() with factory { params: DiceParams -> RandomDice(params) }
}
----


== Multiton binding

A multiton can be thought of a "singleton factory": it guarantees to always return the same object given the same argument.
In other words, for a given argument, the first time a multiton is called with this argument, it will call the function to create an instance; and will always yield that same instance when called with the same argument.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates one random generator for each value
----
val di = DI {
    bind<RandomGenerator>() with multiton { max: Int -> SecureRandomGenerator(max) }
}
----

Just like a factory, a multiton can take multiple (up to 5) arguments.

=== non-synced multiton

Just like a singleton, a multiton synchronization can be disabled:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: non-synced multiton
----
val di = DI {
    bind<RandomGenerator>(sync = false) with multiton { max: Int -> SecureRandomGenerator(max) }
}
----


== Referenced singleton or multiton binding

A referenced singleton is an object that is guaranteed to be single as long as a reference object can return it.
A referenced multiton is an object that is guaranteed to be single for the same argument as long as a reference object can return it.

A referenced singleton or multiton needs a "reference maker" in addition to the classic construction function that determines the type of reference that will be used.

[.lead]
_Kodein-DI_ comes with three reference makers for the JVM:


=== JVM: Soft & weak

These are objects that are guaranteed to be single in the JVM at a given time, but not guaranteed to be single during the application lifetime.
If there are no more strong references to the instances, they may be GC'd and later, re-created.

Therefore, the provided function *may or may not* be called multiple times during the application lifetime.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a Cache object that will exist only once at a given time
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Map>() with singleton(ref = softReference) { WorldMap() } // <1>
    bind<Client>() with singleton(ref = weakReference) { id -> clientFromDB(id) } // <2>
}
----
<1> Because it's bound by a soft reference, the JVM will GC it before any `OutOfMemoryException` can occur.
<2> Because it's bound by a weak reference, the JVM will GC it is no more referenced.

Weak singletons use JVM's `Weak` while soft singletons use JVM's `Soft`.


=== JVM: Thread local

This is the same as the standard singleton binding, except that each thread gets a different instance.
Therefore, the provided function will be called *once per thread* that needs the instance, the first time it is requested.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: creates a Cache object that will exist once per thread
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Cache>() with singleton(ref = threadLocal) { LRUCache(16 * 1024) }
}
----

NOTE: Semantically, thread local singletons should use <<scoped-singletons>>, the reason it uses a referenced singleton is because Java's `ThreadLocal` acts like a reference.

CAUTION: Thread locals are not available in JavaScript.


== Instance binding

This binds a type to an instance that *already exist*.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: a DataSource binding to an already existing instance.
----
val di = DI {
    bind<DataSource>() with instance(SqliteDataSource.open("path/to/file")) // <1>
}
----
<1> Instance is used *with parenthesis*: it is not given a function, but an instance.


[[constant-binding]]
=== Constant binding

It is often useful to bind "configuration" constants.

NOTE: Constants are always <<tagged-bindings,tagged>>.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: two constants
----
val di = DI {
    constant(tag = "maxThread") with 8 // <1>
    constant(tag = "serverURL") with "https://my.server.url" // <1>
}
----
<1> Note the absence of curly braces: it is not given a function, but an instance.

CAUTION: You should only use constant bindings for very simple types without inheritance or interface (e.g. primitive types and data classes).


== Direct binding

Sometimes, it may seem overkill to specify the type to `bind` if you are binding the same type as you are creating.

For this use case, you can transform any `bind<TYPE>() with ...` to `bind() from ...`.

[source,kotlin]
.Example: direct bindings
----
val di = DI {
    bind() from singleton { RandomDice(6) }
    bind("DnD20") from provider { RandomDice(20) }
    bind() from instance(SqliteDataSource.open("path/to/file"))
}
----

CAUTION: *This should be used with care* as binding a concrete class and, therefore, having concrete dependencies is an _anti-pattern_ that later prevents modularisation and mocking / testing.

WARNING: When binding a generic type, the bound type will be the specialized type, +
e.g. `bind() from singleton { listOf(1, 2, 3, 4) }` registers the binding to `List<Int>`.

NOTE: If you are using Kodein/Native, because of https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/1290[this bug], you need to use the uppercase version: `Bind() from`.
This issue has been fixed and the `bind() from` syntax will be available to Kodein/Native as soon as Kotlin/Native 0.6 is released.


== Subtypes bindings

_Kodein-DI_ allows you register a "subtype bindings factory".
These are big words for a simple concept that's best explained with an example:

[source,kotlin]
.Example: direct bindings
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Controller>().subtypes() with { type ->
        when (type.jvmType) { <1>
            MySpecialController::class.java -> singleton { MySpecialController() }
            else -> provider { myControllerSystem.getController(type.jvmType) }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> As `type` is a `TypeToken<*>`, you can use `.jvmType` to get the JVM type (e.g. `Class` or `ParameterizedType`).

In essence, `bind<Whatever>().subtypes() with { type -> binding }` allows you to register, in _Kodein-DI_, a binding factory that will be called for subtypes of the provided type.


== Transitive dependencies

With those lazily instantiated dependencies, a dependency (very) often needs another dependency.
Such classes can have their dependencies passed to their constructor.
Thanks to Kotlin's _killer_ type inference engine, _Kodein-DI_ makes retrieval of transitive dependencies really easy.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: a class that needs transitive dependencies
----
class Dice(private val random: Random, private val sides: Int) {
/*...*/
}
----

It is really easy to bind this `RandomDice` with its transitive dependencies, by simply using `instance()` or `instance(tag)`.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: bindings of a Dice and of its transitive dependencies
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Dice>() with singleton { Dice(instance(), instance(tag = "max")) } // <1>

    bind<Random>() with provider { SecureRandom() } // <2>
    constant(tag="max") with 5 // <2>
}
----
<1> Binding of `Dice`. It gets its transitive dependencies by using `instance()` and `instance(tag)`.
<2> Bindings of `Dice` transitive dependencies.

NOTE: The order in which the bindings are declared has *no importance whatsoever*.

The binding functions are in the same environment as the `newInstance` function described in the <<injection, dependency injection section>>.
You can read it to learn more about the `instance`, `provider` and `factory` functions available to the function.


=== Transitive factory dependencies

Maybe you need a dependency to use one of its functions to create the bound type.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: using a DataSource to create a Connection.
----
val di = DI {
    bind<DataSource>() with singleton { MySQLDataSource() }
    bind<Connection>() with provider { instance<DataSource>().openConnection() } // <1>
}
----
<1> Using a `DataSource` as a transitive factory dependency.


== Being responsible for its own retrieval

If the bound class is <<di-aware,DIAware>>, you can pass the `di` object to the class so it can itself use the DI container to retrieve its own dependencies.

[source, kotlin]
.Example: bindings of Manager that is responsible for retrieving its own dependencies
----
val di = DI {
    bind<Manager>() with singleton { ManagerImpl(di) } // <1>
}
----
<1> ManagerImpl is given a DI instance.
