KOtlin DEpendency INjection
===========================

**_KODEIN_** is a straightforward and yet very useful dependency retrieval container. it is effortless to use and configure.

**_KODEIN_** works on all Kotlin Multiplatform targets:

- JVM / Android.
- all Native platforms (iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, WebAssembly).
- Javascript / WasmJs.

**_KODEIN_** allows you to:

- Lazily instantiate your dependencies when needed
- Stop caring about dependency initialization order
- Bind classes or interfaces to their instance or provider
- Debug your dependency bindings and recursions

**_KODEIN_** provides extensions to be integrable into:

- [Android](https://developer.android.com/)
- [Compose (Android / Desktop / Web)](https://kosi-libs.org/kodein/7.22/framework/compose.html)
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/)

An example is always better than a thousand words:

```kotlin
val di = DI {
    bindProvider<Dice> { RandomDice(0, 5) }
    bindSingleton<DataSource> { SqliteDS.open("path/to/file") }
}

class Controller(private di: DI) {
    private val ds: DataSource by di.instance()
}
```

**_KODEIN_** is a good choice because:

- It proposes a very simple and readable declarative DSL
- It is not subject to type erasure (as Java is)
- It integrates nicely with Android
- It proposes a very kotlin-esque idiomatic API
- It is fast and optimized (makes extensive use of `inline`)

Installation
---------

Kodein is available on Maven Central.

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di:{version}")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**_KODEIN_** 7+ is the current major version, but documentation is available for previous versions.

Our devs love it so much that they've transitioned to using it in their personal apps, both Java and Kotlin!  )
